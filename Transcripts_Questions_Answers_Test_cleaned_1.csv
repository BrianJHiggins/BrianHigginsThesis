4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Mario Lu I have one on NBA 2K and then another high-level question. The first one, NBA 2K, I believe you guys mentioned 58% increase and new user spending. So just curious if you could provide any additional color or specific features that was introduced in this game this year that attributed to this large increase."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Karl Slatoff Hi, it is Karl, Mario. I wouldn't necessarily want to attribute any specific features to the increase, I don't want to tag it, but there have been, certainly, a lot of additions to the game that we believe have increased engagement. Specifically -- just generally speaking, the game is fantastic. I mean, the reviews have been . User, feedback has been  engagement has been really, really strong. One thing to note is that we did add the seasons feature to my player this year, which obviously created a lot more content drops and a lot more of we're supposed to do every time you increase content, deliver content that obviously leads to increase engagement and tends to lead to increased monetization. So it's really a combination of the game, just being better. We had a lot of wind at our backs to from an increased player base, generally speaking, and it's just been a  execution and people are really enjoying the incremental content."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Mario Lu , Karl, and then, Facebook or Meta recently announced a partnership with Rockstar or GTA San Andreas on the quest. Just curious what's the background of this partnership was and do you now think either VR or building a Meta verse could be growth drivers for a Take-Two as a Company going forward?. ."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Strauss Zelnick We're really excited about all of our partnerships, so we have numerous partnerships. We've always said that we want to be where the consumers. And when VR first emerged as a potential technology, while I expressed some skepticism about it becoming a very broad-based consumer application, I also thought it was really exciting technically and said that we would participate on -- Rockstar has already brought L.A. Noire to VR. NBA 2K has come to VR. I'm sure we'll have more VR titles in the future as well. So we're always excited when our creative teams can flex their collective muscles and do different things. And remains to been seen just how big that can be. We never make projections like that, but we're very excited about the opportunities."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Ng Hey, , . I just have 2, first with the upcoming launch of GTA trilogy on mobile. Can you talk a little bit about your ambitions to create immersive core games on mobile, and whether this foreshadows more mobile content in the future that may have historically been reserved for a PC and Console, and then second, just a housekeeping question on the improvement and guidance. What's driving the back-half improvement despite the push out of Marvel's Midnight Suns are there any improved expectations by franchise your call out? ."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Lainie  Goldstein In times of the back half of the year and the forecasts, we are seeing a lot of improvement in the forecasts and have a lot of ups and downs, mostly ups and we're netting up on the titles are looking , engagement is . We don't have any specific things to call out, but overall the titles are doing ."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Matt Cost Hi, everyone. s, I have two. So can you just talk about your expectations  over the next call it a year or two, obviously, you've brought on a lot of heads, you have a lot of content and development, there's a decent amount of it hitting between now and the end of the fiscal year, and then obviously more to come in the years following. What do you guys at a high level in terms of like the margin impact. I would imagine there would be something along the lines of an increase in marketing as you bring games to market, but then benefits from scale as those heads actually produce content that is out, and engaging people, and monetizing actively. Then just the second question is on China. Obviously you quantified that at about 3% of your business and mentioned how you expect the exposure to remain limited. Should we interpret that to mean that you don't intend to launch games in China in the future or under certain circumstances? And what's driving your strategy there going forward? ."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Strauss Zelnick In terms of China, I was making the point about the percent of our net bookings that come from China and it's quite small, roughly 3% at the moment. We expect our net bookings to grow. We expect sequential growth. We're really excited about our future, and at the same time we're very focused on the region, and particularly on the country, in the context of what we're able to do and being compliant with regulations. We remain highly optimistic about China. We absolutely would be very happy to launch additional and new titles there we expect to do so. In fact, we remain optimistic on simply making the point. It is a small part of our business."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Martin Yang .  for taking my question. I have 1. Just curious about your philosophy on remaster of games. How do you pick and choose, from your pretty substantial library, what games to bring back on. And as a follow-up on how the re-mastering games compete with resources for development of new games. ."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Karl Slatoff Sure. This is Karl Martin, I'll answer the question, I'll answer the second one, they're actually related because the truth is, remastering games unless you really go truly out to third-parties, which we've done in the past, but even in that case, you are actually competing that resources and therefore, that goes into your decision making of which ones you bring to market. And it purely is an economic decision. And the economic decision's based on what we believe that the fan base to be, how much is it going to cost for the game to be remastered, are we going to make other changes to the game to enhance the experience, because typically just purely masters. Just ports don't really perform as well as something that's truly remastered or truly enhanced. All of those, all of those factors go into those decisions. But in the end, it is an economic decision and it is a resource allocation decision. And that's just math that we do."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Drew Crum , guys. . Maybe a follow-up to an earlier question. Some of your peers have suggested challenges around recruiting talent, but it sounds like you've had a different experience if I heard correctly, you added 350 developers during the quarter. What do you attribute that to? Are labor markets improving, is reopening helping, and if the macro picture is getting better, is your plan to accelerate new hires? And I have a follow-up."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Strauss Zelnick  for your question. Look, we're so grateful that we continue to attract the industry's top talent. In fact, we've hired over 1500 developers over the last 2 years, and we've more than doubled our internal developer account in the last five years, and I don't want to overstate the case and so much always has to be done on a daily basis regarding culture. But I do think that that's a reflection of who we are and I think ultimately everyone knows who you are. People inside and people outside and we're really proud of the culture that we built. A culture that starts with creativity, innovation, and efficiency. Very importantly, includes accepting everyone as they are, as they show up as long as they are equally focused on very high ambition for excellence and hard work, a willingness to be honest and open and transparent, and collaborative. The agreement that we have with one another that will treat everyone with decency and kindness, and I think at this point we're known for that. We're imperfect, and there's much more than we can do at any given time. We are highly focused on this culture, and it has served us very well."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Drew Crum  for that, Strauss and my follow-up concerns the headlines relat ed to FIFA. Just curious around your interest in furthering your exposure to soccer beyond Top11."
4465194,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",TTWO,11/4/2021,CEO Strauss Zelnick on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Strauss Zelnick We're so thrilled to have Nordeus in the Take-Two family. They're just crushing it, which is . Top11 is a  title, a beloved title. I just couldn't be happier to be in the soccer manager business through Top11 with the Nordeus team. That's a big step forward for us. We haven't been in that sport before, and I think I'll leave it at that today."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joe Greff , everybody.  for taking my question. Jonathan, Bill, I would like to talk a little bit about the capital allocation approach that you referenced on the call particularly that seconds still about returning cash to shareholders. I was hoping maybe you could talk about it in a different way and think about returning cash to shareholders, maybe near-term, medium-term, and long-term. Obviously  in the near-term, you have more cash coming in and you get another $5 or $600 million from Mirage. That's just even more to play with. Longer-term you have Japan but that's not going to be a huge source on in any given year. And then medium-term you have whatever external growth opportunities that maybe you want to talk about how you're thinking about that. But then, when you think about that general overlay, how do you think about the timing of capital return? And the capital return that you mentioned, Jonathan, that the share repurchases in October is -- has that paused or is that still ongoing?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Hornbuckle And Joe just maybe additional color, look through COVID through obviously the  recession, we've got some deferred maintenance so there's a couple of projects we're going to do here regarding rooms and catching up. Not a massive amount of capital in relative terms, but real money. We are just getting started in the digital world. You understand what we've done today and as we continue to think about expanding that business with partners, through partners, or with others, that'll take some capital. Clearly it's a space in a place we've indicated many times we want to be progressive in and be dominant in, in a both domestic and potentially a global basis. And so, I think that will take some cash. Japan, you're right is down the road. It's probably not until '24 and beyond. And New York, hopefully, they'll start earlier, I'm hoping in '23. We've given an opportunity to deploy some cash there and start to grow that business. We see it as a unique opportunity sitting on 97 acres, 15 miles in Downtown Manhattan. We can't help but think we could do more there. And so those are some of the immediate things that I think lie ahead. And then obviously, we'll wait and see."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Katz Hi. Evening, everyone.  for taking my questions. I wanted to, again, go back to some of the capital allocation and pick number 3 on the list, Jonathan, which I think was external investments in a disciplined way where you feel like you have a clear advantage. And given all of the prospective events around your partner, BetMGM, I just wanted to see if there are any updated thoughts or perspectives that you can share with respect to your -- the outstanding share BetMGM and your end-to-end."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Hornbuckle . So David, look, obviously there remains a  deal enthusiasm in the market. We all saw -- and obviously we were an insider to a certain degree to the experience that DraftKings and Entain just went through. Time to tell where that all goes, if it goes anywhere. We enjoy our partnership, I think we're doing well by it. Would they've been good partners as it relates to the day-to-day business activity? We'd like to do more domestically and whether we ultimately do more internationally or not with or without them I think time will tell as well. But for now, we're going to wait and see what happens to that marketplace for a while."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Katz Perfect. And as my follow-up, just one detail. With respect to the fourth quarter, I suppose particularly in Las Vegas, it sounds like October has gotten off to a very strong start. But any helpful thoughts around what a new normal for the fourth quarter could be? We would normally think it might be a little bit softer than 3Q with some holidays. But just the puts and takes in review would be really helpful."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Corey Sanders David, it's Corey, what I would also add traditionally pre -giving to right about the week before Christmas is traditionally slow. We, similar to last year, we're seeing some pretty good pickup during the giving period. So this is unlike any other Third and Fourth Quarter and so it's hard to say whether -- what the new norm would be, but we're pretty optimistic about the pickup we're seeing, especially midweek. Weekends are -- every weekend from now until the end of the year is strong with strong ADR pick-up. We've got -- remember, we've got the [Indiscernible] programming every other, you got for example, this weekend you've got rolling stones at Allegiant. That's 50,000 seater. So programming just looks ."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Thomas Allen . On BetMGM, couldn't help but notice that you took out the billion-dollar revenue guide to next year because you're already breaking $800 million this year. Any updated thinking around next year?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jonathan Halkyard At this point, no. But we'll, I'm sure introduce a revised estimate for 2022 during our fourth quarter call."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Thomas Allen Okay. A follow-up on BetMGM just -- there is some news reports out that you're one of the winning operators in New York, can you just help us think about how you're going to operate in that market with such a high tax rate?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jonathan Halkyard Well, look, I can assure you we want to 62% crowd. It's probably going to end up at 50%. Time to tell, but I think that's what we're all contemplating, be 9 or 10 operatives give or take. Going into it, I'm happy we have a property there. The omni -channel thing we talked about is relevant and real. We all understand it because we're in New Jersey, it's one of the more expensive media markets in the world. But I will tell you it is the largest market we will launch into date with M life database. Obviously we haven't launched them in Southern California or California so as a database way to think about this, and we'll be there day one, which is also critical. So I think we'll get off to a  start. Time will tell with sports how much money is to be made. Again, for us, it's an omni -channel play. It's a brand play and we're going to have a huge presence there. And hopefully someday we get to online, I-casino, but that's something for well down the road."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dan Polser Hey, , everyone.  for taking my questions. So first on BetMGM, in just -- in terms of the value there, we all see the same level valuations for sports betting IME operators. Now that you're competing, arguably for the top spot here in terms of overall share, do you think you're getting full value for it in your stock and if not, how do you think about some of the levers that you might pull to maybe on lock that full value?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Hornbuckle Well,?EB's price there the? answer is no. If I look at DraftKings and others as a multiple. Obviously it's complicated inside a huge Company and a huge story, and we have a JV that's not in the context of basic structure. It's not pure in terms of value creation, so we understand all of that. I think as you look forward though, that we've had all enough exposure and experience to understand a couple of things. BetMGM is here to stay. It'll be a dominant player in this space. We can argue every day, all day 1, 2, or 3, what's really relevant to us are two things, we dominate in iGaming, principally based on the heels of legacy of who and what we are. I think the BetMGM folks put up a  gaming product. We've seen our branded products work exceptionally well. We have huge database to lean into it and ultimately we are going to have a huge reward mechanism with the omni -channel idea of coming to Las Vegas for some of our regional properties to enjoy themselves with a  retail footprint. I mean, not only are we in the places that are obvious but next year in Arizona at the Cardinal Stadium, we're going to have a presence. We're literally opening as we speak in that stadium a betting shop and so we're going to be in other places and we have an opportunity finally with Illinois freeing up, to get into Illinois come hopefully March or April of next year. And so no, obviously, we think there could be more value accretive to it. It is complicated, but we know we have a serious bet. We know we have a serious play and we're continuing to invest. And hopefully wisely, I'd like to think we've been a little bit more prudent and judicious than others. But it's it's not for the ill of heart as we know, and I still think we'll see more consolidation over time, which I think ultimate wil l be accretive to the players that remain."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dan Polser Got it. . And just for my follow-up, in terms of BetMGM for the revenue guidance, I think you said $800 million in the deck, which would imply something like a sequential decrease versus 3Q. Is there anything to read into there in terms of seasonality or maybe increased promotions from competitors that might pressure your iGaming revenues?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Hornbuckle It's 800 plus by the way, notice there's a little plus sign in that deck. So we didn't go backwards, to the contrary, football got off to a rougher start in September. But all that being s aid, no, it's motivated and growing in the right direction. I think you've heard Jonathan year-over-year 5 times more in terms of first-time deposits in September. We like the trajectory of the business. Arizona is off to a massive start for us and obviously we've got some other states yet to come here. So, no. We don't want to give a real number because we are truly studying it because we want to hold ourselves accountable to it. So we will, by the Fourth Quarter though."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shaun Kelley Hey, , everyone. Maybe wanted to touch on a couple of other areas, since we've covered a lot of ground on BetMGM, maybe it was wondering 2 specifically would be 1, Jonathan, was your comment on the margin outlook in Las Vegas. Should you give a little bit more color on you expect that to maybe trend sequentially, you're into '22 just given as you of re-ramp costs? That'd be really helpful. And then my follow-up would be if you could just talk a little bit more about the sale of The Mirage. How specifically do you identify that property as maybe the right 1 out of the portfolio to look for options for?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Hornbuckle And then on the Mirage, if you think about our portfolio particularly here in Las Vegas, look there is no better place in the context of history of Las Vegas, there are no better bones. It's a center of the Strip. It was built to last and it has. There's 77 acres, many of -- much of it's really undeveloped in the context of what could be there but as we look at capital allocation and we look at the notion of diversification, we have enough of Las Vegas. And so -- and we look at the marketplace right now, obviously we're buying and selling at the same time so we understand the marketplace. We all heard Tom read yesterday, we agree. We think there is an opportune time and that we think this might be at to sell an asset Las Vegas. And so it became for us the obvious one, as we think about our portfolio, we think about things going forward and capital allocation. And so no discredit to what's been done there. It's an amazing property and I'm excited for somebody to come in and make it their Marquee property. I think between the Villas that are there, the access to the real estate, it's general location, I think the right owner could do a lot but it just felt pretty far down in the spectrum of how much of capital we'd allocate to it in any given period of time in the near future. And so we just took a strategic decision to sell it."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chad Beynon Hi. .  for taking my question. Wanted to go back on BetMGM. Just from a product or tech standpoint, we've seen a lot of new features and just different products that have rolled out. Is there anything from a same-day parlay, live dealer, social features that you currently aren't offering that others are to help with retention? And I guess if not, is there anything on the come that'll help you keep your customer base as others are pretty aggressive with marketing? ."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Hornbuckle I mean, fair question, Chad. I mean, all of the above. We have just launched with Evolution some product out of New Jersey and we are doing the same in Michigan with Live dealer. We think it's an integral part of the business and something that people are leaning more and more into will be there. Same with same-day parlay. We've got a bunch of product work and revisions. We didn't want to do it in the middle of football season. That tends to -- as we tried to do some couple things last year got us in a little bit of trouble. And so we'll continue to evolve. The  part about relationship with Entain is there are literally 3,500 people in [Indiscernible] who are focused on a lot of their businesses, but primarily ours. And so Adam and their whole team, Matt, and Company, have about 8 or 9 things, shared wallet, all kinds of things that will change that dynamic and continue to develop that product as a priority because it will be part of the race over the next couple of years in terms of getting and sustaining and retaining customers."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chad Beynon Okay. . And then separately regarding some comments you made before about the hub and spoke approach, owning and operating some premier assets around the country outside of Las Vegas that you can feed into Vegas . Does the acquisition of CityCenter and Cosmo and the disposition of Mirage change how you're thinking about that given that your properties will just skew more luxury pro forma?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Hornbuckle No, not really. I think I understood the nature of the question is we skew up the spectrum will the regional property be able to feed that? I would still suggest with Excalibur, Luxor, and New York to a certain degree park and to a certain degree MGM of [Indiscernible]. Remember, we got 40,000 rooms in Las Vegas to fill. And what is clear and differentiating between us and Caesar's is our casino marketing share is 100 basis points behind their's in terms of market mix. And so no, I think there's room and opportunity for both simultaneous."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jon Galligan Yes.  for taking the call. 2 questions, 1, can you talk a little bit about whether you've seen a recovery in Macau post Golden Week with COVID cases now coming down? And secondly, also on Macau, can you talk a little bit about where we are with the concession process now that the public consultation period has ended? What happens next and where do you see this going?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Grambling Hi, . My first question is just really a follow-up on Bet MGM and I may have missed this, but what is the current split of the $227 million in revenues between iGaming and sports betting and then as you noted, omni -channel, customers tend to be more valuable. How do you strategically align incentives between managers of your physical assets and those that Bet MGM to ensure you maximize the total value?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Hornbuckle Well, for competitive reasons, I'm not going to give out the outright split, but just say it leans heavy iGaming, which I think longer-term speaks to the success of the model that we're pursuing. We have -- and one of the reasons that the iGaming is doing so well, it's both the product and ultimately the team there and CRM has done an amazing job. Reports of the job that I want to catch up with MGM too in the context of reaching out to customers, understanding game types, cycles, what they like to do, how they like to do, how to personalize it for them, identifying them. And then we have hosting groups both at BetMGM and MGM that are tied together. We have, for example, on-site here we have a Vice President of Marketing, whose principal and only job is to market to and make sure programs are attached to Bet MGM in those customers. Whether it's sign-up when somebody registered at Aria down to making sure their best customers are taking care of. Making sure they get tickets for what they may want to have earned or done. And so , we're as linked up as one can be at this point in time. I think we have some work to do on the back-end loyalty to make a completely seamless. But now through tier credits, they have exposure to anything and everything they want and can get. And so -- again, we lean heavily into iGaming, I feel really good about it. And we'll continue to develop product and it's a combination of branded product, homemade products, and licenses with some of the biggest brands. And generally speaking, doing very well."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Grambling And then maybe one other follow-up for Jonathan regarding simplification and capital allocation. Can you remind us after all is said and done with Cosmo and MGP, where is the least adjusted net de bt to EBITDA enterprise-wide and as we look at the U.S. versus China, and how do you think about the right leverage on the business as we think about those capital allocation priorities? ."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jonathan Halkyard Yeah.  for the question. We'll be updating that next year as we get closer to the closure of the MGP transaction and clearly to provide that metric right now would be to provide guidance into 2022 consolidated EBITDA and we're not going to do that yet. Regarding the question around leverage for the business. I do think on a lease adjusted basis, this business can comfortably sustain 4 to 5 times leverage and that's adjusting our lease expense at 8 times the rent which is the convention and observers of the Company. I think given the Company's diversification both geographically as well as by business segment, that we can sustain that level of leverage. But as we get into next year and closer to -- closer to the closure of these transactions we will update where those measures are."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robin Farley . . I wanted to go back to BetMGM for a moment. During the quarter, Bill I think [Indiscernible] mentioned publicly the potential to buyout your joint venture partner and I guess how should we think about whether that would be a better outcome for you than having the joint venture with them [Indiscernible], would you essentially use those tech help if you were to buy out the other half of the joint venture?"
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Hornbuckle , Robin. Look, obviously a  deal of commentary speculation in editorialization back and forth over the last 45 days. We would not do eventually without technology. This is a technology-based enterprise at the end of the day. And so that becomes a key point of what to do and how we think about our future. Given the environment that was being described, there was potentially an opportunity to walk away with technology. And so that would've been interesting. We were prepared to do it if in fact the other parties could get to the finish line or decide to get to the finish line. There wasn't at all of the details worked out, but time to tell whether that ultimately gets to -- that looks whenever, but time to tell whether we ultimately end up in a different place. For now though, again, let's go back to where we were. We were contempt and happy with our business. How it's progressing. We wouldn't do it without a technology platform to be sure, and right now I'm not anxious to do it. I mean, I like where we are to developing business. I like the fact that untamed shares and half of this development costs. It's a progressive and aggressive environment as we know. And so I still like where we are, but I'm not -- we did comment earlier that we want to be bigger, we want to be global, we want to be a lot of things. And time will tell how we ultimately project into that space."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robin Farley Okay. . That's helpful. . And if I could ask a follow-up on the margin topic, the margin of your operations. I think that you might have said the last quarter that you thought you would keep about half of the margin improvement when things stabilize. I may not be remembering that right but is that -- I don't think I heard you say that today, and so I'm wondering if you're thinking higher than that or lower than that when you think about that stabilization. ."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jonathan Halkyard Yeah, that's a fair estimate. It's -- really it's difficult to anticipate right now,just given the way in which the business mix ultimately levels out, but that's not a bad estimate."
4465205,MGM Resorts International,MGM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Hornbuckle on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Jonathan Halkyard Yes. Our view of the way that our margins evolve has really not changed in the past quarter.
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Toshiya Hari Hi guys. .  so much for taking the question. I have two if I may. My first one is probably for Mark. The 17% sequential decline you're guiding to in your mobile business for December, it's probably hard, but can you sort of break that down into supply factors and demand factors to the extent possible? And then on the demand side, you talked about weakness in Asia, but if you can elaborate on that, that would be super helpful. And I got a quick, quick follow-up."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Mark Murphy Sure. So Toshiya, we decrease our December number about a $150 million as you can see. And -- about $135 million that was in mobile where we went from roughly $965 to $830 in the December quarter. The balance of that decrease was IDP. IDP is the most straightforward. It's all supply in IDP, so just keep that in mind. Of the $135, roughly, in mobile, as we characterize supply constraints, which is our suppliers not having supply for us, our customers not having the chipsets, thus not able to build their product and use our product, and then finally, our own internal constraints. We see up to a $100 million that we would characterize as supplier-related of that $135 million. The balance -- so $35 million we would view as net demand. Some demand is up and we're able to intercept that. But some demand is clearly down and I think that's well publicized, particularly in parts of Asia. So, broad brush strokes, we're 3 quarters or less down on supply in mobile, and 1 quarter or more related to demand. Now, if you add in IDP, which is all supply, then that proportion is stronger. So that's our view, Toshiya."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Toshiya Hari .  for the color. And then, as my follow-up, you guys talked quite a bit about having constructive longer-term conversations with your customers. You also talked about your long-term silicon supply agreement. As you compare and contrast the visibility you have today versus three years ago, five years ago, how would you characterize the key differences? I'm sure you've had long-term agreements in the past, but how much bigger are they as a percentage of your backlog and how enforceable are they going forward relative to history? ."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Eric Creviston Sure. This is Eric. I'll take that. I think one of the silver linings in this environment is how constructed their conversations have gotten in terms of much longer-term. So not just 1 or even 2 years, but in some cases up to 3 years of discussions about how we're going to outline both our technology and supply roadmap to our customers product roadmaps, their markets and what they expect to ship. And there is no crystal ball, it's not perfect, but at least we have ranges of alignment and sort of volume bars, share windows and things like this that we can talk both to our customers and to our suppliers. And, I think for suppliers it's a  benefit to them, and thus to have more stability and for our customers, of course, the supply assurance is paramount. And for us to have more confidence in our growth of the businesses is, of course, very important as well. It's a very different environment driven by all the factors we've talked about already on this call."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Vivek Arya  for taking my question. For the first one, I'm curious, given the supply constraints in the industry, does that change the competitive landscape in the RF side in some areas as we look at next year? For example, one of your competitors, again bundled their apps processors and modems along the RF side, do you think that give them, perhaps an advantage from a competitive perspective as we look at next year?"
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Bob Bruggeworth This is Bob,  for your question. I think the other point that's interesting is that a lot  of the things that our customers are waiting on are from some of those very people you mentioned. So I think we need to keep that in mind, it's not us the primary reason. It's -- we have the parts. We can get the parts for them. They've been saying as we've mentioned, many times through last quarter as well as this quarter challenges our customers are having with Mac sets are kitting whatever vocabulary you want to use. That's been their bigger problem is in SoCs, not with RF front-ends, at least not from us."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Vivek Arya All right. Then on the acquisition that was announced, I was hoping you could give us some more color in terms of what is the right way to reflect that in the model? And our sense of the Silicon Carbide and the power semi spaces, it's in front of a very large growth opportunity and auto than industrial and so forth. But it's a very capital intensive space, night and a number of the established players have margins well below your corporate average. So but what's the right way to think about the strategy? And is it going to be accretive overtime for you?"
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"James Klein This is James. As you as you stated, we like the aspect that it gets us into several fast-growing markets like electric vehicles, industrial power, and data centers. Maybe in longer-term, even in things like Circuit Protection. We see it all in current year, expanding our adjustable market by almost a billion dollars. And we think that certainly continues to grow at a high growth rate as we go over the next several years. We do believe that we have the industry leading performance inefficiency and in die-size. So we think when we compare those differentiated type capabilities with our existing power management capabilities, we really do believe we have the ability to continue to grow and scale the business."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Blayne Curtis .  for my question. I just want to go back on the supply issues. If you look at the shipments from the two major modem companies, I guess they're out and you're seeing a correction. So just kind of curious, there's a couple of ways that could happen. Just curious if now in retrospect, did you ship more RF than maybe modems in the first half of the year and that has to correct? Or -- just kind of curious to hear your thoughts on that. I know you probably haven't seen Qualcomm's guide, but [Indiscernible] MediaTek, you're not seeing as sharp of a decline in December. Just thoughts between the disconnect there."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Eric Creviston Yeah Blayne, this is Eric, yeah, it's a , and I think to a certain extent, there's some of that and I think a lot of it comes down to mix as well. I think we did a good job of responding to customer demand. We still have several parts where we're on allocation as well and chasing in behind of course, as we talked about. But for the most part, we did a pretty good job of satisfying customer demand. But what happens is as the mix shifts, I mean, they are essentially taking every base band chip they can get regardless of which our efforts on. So it could be that net-net wish just a bit ahead up to this point."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,Blayne Curtis Okay. And then just your perspective on it.
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Mark Murphy I was just going to add Blayne that -- listen, we're disappointed with the December guide, but I think it's also to reinforce our commitment to keep the channel healthy and give you a guide best we see on the supply demand fronts. But it's never easy but admittedly, it's more difficult than usual environment right now. I do think it's important with this adjustment to step back, not lose sight of how good a business we've got. For this fiscal year, we call down. But that was -- and we've missed, but that's a -- there is an aged consensus that clearly the supply environment worsened through the quarter, particularly in mid to late September. And then these publicized weakness in demand emerged. We see things improving. We think December is as bad as it gets for us and we see improving in March, and broadly. We had given a guidance range of 15% to 20%, and with this 2.5% adjustment for the year were down at the lower end of that range. So we're still in the range that we had provided. Listen, our gross margin outlook is intact around 52%. OpEx is in control and we're investing in the future of the business. That's both traditional parts of the business and newer parts of the business. And in the end, we're taken EPS roughly a dime above $12 to roughly a dime below $12. And so there is a bit of a correction there, but I would say it's the right thing for us to do. If we look into next year and beyond, we're just feeling  about our position. Now, premium technology and products serving attractive end markets, growing double-digits, and we expect to grow double-digits. We're operating well sustaining margins over 52%, expanding operating margins. So lot to talk about in the positive beyond this quarter."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Blayne Curtis And I guess when you look at your supply constraints on these constraints in your business, but you did grow inventory in September with that level of sales. So I guess I'm looking at our sales down team. So I guess I'm wondering, I guess the supply situation getting that bad between September, December, or is there another factor there? I'm just trying to understand those moving pieces."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Mark Murphy No, we're -- it did get worse in mid to late September, Blayne, for sure. And that's what we've tried to explain. And first it was the supply environment, which has been tough for a year-and-a-half, almost 2 years now, the supply environment got worse. And then, demand over the past 3 weeks or so has deteriorated. But our work are -- in some of that inven tory is just again, it's mixed match of sets and so forth, like DAP. But having said that, our inventories are okay. Our turns are at the high end of historical range and even with the slowdown, the turns will be within the normal historical range. So we -- yeah, this is why we're dealing with this now. And again, we think it's a short-term issue that we work through and are in better shape in the March quarter."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Karl Ackerman Yes. . For your December quarter outlook, are the bottlenecks you described, at least for mobile, are they concentrated in the Android ecosystem? And then if I may, just as a follow-up, if you could highlight whether the growth trajectory of Android into December is better or worse than your guide of down 17 from Mobile. That would be very helpful. ."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Eric Creviston Yeah. Karl, this is Eric. I don't think we can break them up between ecosystems like that and give anymore color, given the concentration of the ecosystem."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Karl Ackerman Okay. If I may then, just going back to this acquisition, you've made in Silicon Carbide. I understand that most of UnitedSiC's products are aimed at high-voltage server and general industrial power supplies, where you have some pretty good customer overlap today, but could you discuss your plans, go-to-market for UnitedSiC and whether they have existing relationships with Tier-1 automotive OEMS? ."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"James Klein So today you're right. I mean, it's predominantly it's -- I would say on the lower voltage scale and it's in power supplies around automotive and data center applications. If you look at how we plan to take the business on a go-forward basis. Certainly, we'll use our channels to expand substantially. As you know, we've got a broad based into the automotive, and in many other places. Like for defense market, we will be able to take this technology over the long term. We’ll also be skilled the technology up in voltage, which will allow us to enter other parts of the automotive space, motor controls and things like that on a go-forward basis."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Gary Mobley Hey guys,  for taking my question. I wanted to pick up with some line of questioning on the acquisition. James, your core competency historically in wide-band-gap semiconductor materials, and correct me if I'm wrong, has been in GaN power or I'm sorry, GaN RF. And Sil -- United Silicon Carbide's core competency, of course, is in silicon carbide and the Company's always manu -- outsource manufacturing to X-FAB. And so my question is the plan to eventually bring in the manufacturing, internally leveraging some of the core VOS historical wide band gap processing capabilities. And it related to trying to penetrate the automotive market. It has been important so far for car OEMS to align with Silicon Carbide providers that are vertically stacked with BAWS materials in power devices for supply chain security. And so, my question is as a matter of strategy, is that the intent long term for this business?"
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"James Klein Let me take the second 1 first. Certainly we'll use our very large and strong supply chain to make sure we supply that. And of course, we have expertise also in very high power packaging. So we'll combine that with the power control that we have from the active Semiconductor acquisition. That's been a couple of years ago now and we really intend to take this business much more into a module play where we will have an integrated capability and of course we'll use our supply chain to make sure we've got stable supply of raw material and the ability to manufacture the wafers and things like that. As far as moving inside will certainly as we go over to the period scale on the business, we're going to take a hard look at what makes sense and what doesn't make sense. I think there's a part of that process that maybe will adapt well to some of our internal capabilities and some that may be a bit more of a challenge. And I think we will just look at that as we go through the next several years, as we scale to see what makes the most economic since go-forward basis."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Gary Mobley . And correct me from using the wrong term here, but the prepayment of waiver."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Snyder  very much. Eric, it's clear that Qualcomm is gaining some share in the low and mid-high in -- low in China in Samsung's mass market. How can you be sure that some of your demand weakness isn't share loss in a few slots in that area? I know they don't participate as much in [Indiscernible] but I'm just trying to figure out how you figure that out, given some of their gains. And then Mark, I'm really puzzled by this SIC power acquisition. Buying wafers from premium foundry through X-FAB will work if you would see this is like the industrial market or more of a diversified analog, but you think that huge disadvantage and scale against ST Infineon, and especially we will speed new foundry in New York. So I'm just curious, where do you see this going? What leverage do you think you can full or leverage do you have for this new acquisition to get you into EVs so it isn't going to be cost? And given the size of the fab and the fact that they will be fabing on wafers you come and get the 200 millimeter wafers. You're going to be facing a big issue in terms of scale too. So I'm just trying to get a little bit more clarity on what markets you're addressing, what I think. And then I have one final question for James before he leaves."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"James Klein This is James. I'll take on the acquisition question. So for us that -- the technology benefit there is low loss and therefore smaller die size. We agree, competitive market, but we are sort of the high-end performance side of that side of the market. So it's going to take -- it's going to take that customer set that's really, really looking for a high performance part. Now, go-forward basis will take both the power management things that we have in the prior acquisition and our packaging capability and we'll move more into a module space. And again, we'll do that selectively where we see parts of the market that are really going to be driven by performance. So we're not trying to take on the world."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,Edward Snyder So you couldn't be high-performance application specific in the module side of it. But do you did mention EBs quite a bit and all EBs you build into big modules for products --
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,James Klein They'll be high-performance applications in that space as well.
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Snyder Okay. And that agency you go. I know it's under time maybe we've got that time, but I will miss the coming down at bugging you but before you get off and push off into the Prairie, I had a question about your 5G. You guided or the guide for IDP was outside of China, you going to expect to see growth given how pervasive China was for the 5G infrastructure business, and how it's not coming back in the U.S. looks to be a lot more skittish about what's the long-term next year, 5G for IDP, will you get back to the point where the 5G MIMO stuff is at parity where you were in China or do you expect that to be a longer haul? ."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Christopher Rolland , guys. I did want to kind of go back to Bl aine's earlier question. So Qualcomm did post some very impressive RFFE numbers. There now at about $1.2 billion a quarter and probably going up from there. And they actually said that their supply constraints were lessening and had been better than initially expected. So I did want to circle back on the differences between you and them and what you're seeing here in December. I think you guys did say could be a timing, it could be an inventory issue. But I'd really love to flush the rest out here. Is there a difference tied to more MediaTek modem centric customers, or different OEM customers here. Is there anything else that would mark the difference between the tail?"
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Eric Creviston No, just maybe the distinction. I'm not saying Karl comps not doing well, they've got some drivers, of course. I think my response to that, I know it's not at our expense. So we're not losing share to them, which the question."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Christopher Rolland Yes.  for that. And indeed the millimeter wave is a big portion for sure. And then I did want to switched to M&A for a second and congrats on acquisition. It's their union Silicon -- Silicon, sorry, and DecaWave. These do appear to be somewhat niche businesses and I guess my question is, do you guys have a desire for more broad-based businesses or even a catalog business, whether it's analog or micro-controller, or mix signal, something like that, and what is your desire to move in that direction?"
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Mark Murphy Yeah, I would have this smart guy. I would just add that we're looking at this several years out and they're most definitely not niche businesses at that point. I mean the TAM that we see associated with $1.6 billion or so acquisitions that we've done over the last several years. And I'm including this recent $200 million plus on United Silicon Carbide. We see that TAM at about $5 billion. We see that TAM doubling to 10 billion or more over the next several years. So, we expect these businesses to be material and enjoy that growth, which is significant. And that's not including biotechnologies."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Christopher Rolland Very good points. ,  a lot and congrats on the acquisition."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Dennis . This is Dennis on for Raji, so I just wanted to ask you guy’s a question regarding the comments you made about mass-market handsets and the content increases. Could you provide some more color, please, about what you're seeing, how much of a difference you're seeing in percent? I think yo u'd mentioned it was higher versus high-end kind of 5G handsets. Can you please talk in a little bit more detail about that?"
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Eric Creviston Sure. Looking at the RF content in -- as 5G proliferates down, we've said there's like a $5 to $7 increase from 4G advanced pro, for example, up to the 5G. And what we said previously is what's interesting is we've see that $5 to $7 consistent as the phones go down. So on a high-tier phone, high-tier smartphone, you might be looking at $30 to $35 RF, Bob, and you’re adding $5 to $7 to that. That's a good growth. But as you go down into the mid-tier, you're adding that $5 to $7 on top of maybe $13 or $10 in some cases. So I think that was like the interesting content growth story as you go down some of the fundamental RF challenges in 5G that drive a lot of complexity around filtering and multi-band, multi-mode operation, receive diversity requirements going up, transplant diversity coming and so forth. All of that are independent of Tier because they're not -- a lot of them aren't driven specifically by consumer feature. Some things that you see it's driven just as much by network infrastructure, efficiency and economies driven by the providers -- the carriers. I think that's the essence of the comments we made in the past that you're asking about."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Dennis That was perfect. . And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to cast you regarding the gross margins. You had mentioned that kind of gross margins are holding above this quarter despite challenges. Can you discuss the chief drivers of this resilience in the gross margins, please."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,Mark Murphy We've covered that at length in previous calls and it's the same factors which is what we had hoped would happen. So we have premium products and do allow us to price better and compete where we most want to compete. We've maintained a utilization of our factory network. We continue to drive productivity programs aggressively. And it's these and other factors that have contributed to the gross margin quantum improvement. And then the consistency we are seeing.
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Ambrish Srivastava I had a question on the demand side. What are your assumptions for the Asia market in the March quarter? Do -- are you assuming a snap back or what is embedded in your guide for what you think about that market? And then you made a comment on holding back to keep the channel healthy. Can you talk a little bit about -- give us some color on what the channel inventory looks like? And for my follow-up, Mark, given all the tightness, you have kept cap intensity very low for a while. Does that change in fiscal '23? ."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Eric Creviston Right, and more so -- first of all, looking at the mobile market, you asked about Asia specifically in March. I mean, clearly I think as you saw from our guide, this is not a normal year, right? We're booking seasonality in our projection in March going up. So I think that's -- there's no norm abnormality here to the seasonality. So we're expecting that it will be roughly in line growing a bit over December quarter most likely."
4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Eric Creviston Oh, sorry. The channel inventory. Yes, that also varies dramatically by part numbers as we talked about. We have some where we're back up to healthy levels. For sure, others that we're still absolutely hand-to-mouth there or even constrained on in some cases, so there's a wide range. But we've been saying, I think over the past quarter or two, that we're beginning to see channel inventories begin to get healthier and in some parts we've definitely gotten there and that's where we're making sure that we don't over ship into the channel, to Mark's point."

4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Eric Creviston Well, one thing in which I don't think we've touched on in this call yet, we do see very, very lean inventories in the finished goods channel. So in terms of phone inventory in the channel from Weibo and Xiaomi, we don't -- we see pretty tight discipline there. We don't see overbuilds and phone inventory building up. I'm not sure if you're asking that or whether they're building up a stockpile of memory chips. I don't know. I can't comment on that."

4465213,"Qorvo, Inc.",QRVO,11/4/2021,CEO Bob Bruggeworth on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Mark Murphy Ambrish, on your CapEx question, it's still our long-term goal to keep our capital-intensity as low as we can as we grow and stay around that mid-single digit as a percent of sales. That will move a bit up and down as we're going through various investment cycles but that's the long-term goal. I do think it's important to call out that our CapEx is staying at sustained levels, and through this weaker period in December because we see on the other side of it, and it's -- we're only talking to March quarter where we see things riding. We see next year as being a good year, and so we need to invest capacity to realize that growth potential."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ari Klein . It sounds like new customer net adds have been up a fair bit this year and the channel partnerships are doing really well. Can you provide some additional color on what you're seeing there, maybe where you're seeing the most traction from new customers, and also in the channel from a regional standpoint."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Sure, yes, I mean,-- I think we're seeing strength across the board, but really the enterprise side of the business, I think is where a lot of the new customer ads are coming from. And most of those, about 60% are coming through channel, as we talked about in the script. So we're seeing a big uptick that said more than 35% percent of the bookings coming through the channel. And I think it's been really encouraging, We're really seeing strength with our top channel partners and really our top alliance partners in particular, who are really engaged in joint enterprise pursuit with us. In terms of pursuing hybrid multi-cloud opportunities and people implementing hybrid architectures. And so -- in fact, I'll give you a start. We had our top 4 alliance partners in this quarter accounted for 10% of the total bookings. And that's not 10% of the channel book, is that 10% of the total bookings. So really strong momentum with the channel partners and it's across a number of verticals and it's across a number of use cases, but real strength in terms of how people are thinking about using corporate data to draw insights, how they, therefore, want to store that data centrally, act on it from a variety of cloud resources, and then, also AI as a key driver. In fact, we had a big win -- big joint win with NVIDIA on that front as we talked about in the script, and so really  progress there, and I think the range of use cases is really strong. We had -- in fact we had an event today that we call Connects (ph) that was -- we had I think about 500 registrations for that event -- for enterprises talking about a variety of use cases implemented on Fabric and so we're seeing some really good momentum."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ari Klein . And then just on churn, it's tracking well below where it's been in historically. What's driving that and how sustainable do you think that is moving forward?"
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Again, I do think that that's a durable trend. I would always comment that there's some potential lumpiness in churn at times. But I think if you look at the trend line on that, it's been the line of best fit is clearly downward there. And so we've had a good year. And as we said, we expect our full-year churn to be toward the bottom end of the range that we talked about, %2 to %2.5. And I think the big driver of that is really mix of business. We're getting the right time deployments, right kinds of customers, right kind of use cases. And I think that's a lot of credit to our sales and marketing team in terms of what they're doing from a targeting perspective, and to our commercial teams in terms of how we're really sort of focusing the business. I do think it's durable and I think that's going to be a -- continue to be a key driver in the business going forward."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jordan Sadler . Wanted touch base on some of the inflationary pressures that have been affecting folks. First, just maybe you could talk about the impact, if any, rising power costs may have had in the quarter on your full-year guide. And maybe elaborate if you could, your hedging protocol by region."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Sure. I'll start and then Keith can jump in if he wants to add anything, but I'd say this, other than some small 1-time items on the power side that had a slight impact on our Q4 guide, we're seeing power cuts pretty much come in where we expected for the remainder of the year and into early next year, I think there's more going to be the longer-term volatility into 2022 that we're really looking at. But as you said, similar to currency we've got a pretty extensive hedging program that really feathers in our hedges over a multiyear period. And we're about 85% hedged in the unregulated markets which represent most of our largest markets. And so our contracts do allow for us to adjust pricing based on underlying costs. And we're actively working to implement adjustments where we think that's appropriate. But, again, you guys, I think recognize our businesses is different in they were more heavily circuit based on our power mix. So whereas it's a little more seamless and pass through those costs in immediate power environment, takes a little more finesse to do that in the circa base power environment. B ut I would say that we act -- as I've said, we're actively working that in terms of how to do it. And I'd say that our experience in Europe with the cross-connect pricing increases over the last couple of years, really give us some confidence that we'll be able to go get that done effectively. So no doubt there's more volatility in the energy markets. So we're watching those closely, and we're going to continue to adapt our strategies accordingly."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jordan Sadler And just I guess as a follow-up, just one, what would the presenting the portfolio is sort of circuit billing oriented. And then when you factor in some of the ability to pass some of this through, what's sort of the benefit that you may be layered in there in terms of top-line?"
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers About 80% of the -- about 80% of the portfolio is circuit based. And again, that's been a key to our -- that 's part of our overall return story. We've been very effective in terms of driving sort of aggregate returns across space and power because of that circuit based power component of the business, and so in terms of its really more a matter of how effective can we be in terms of passing through price increases, underlying costs increase increases in the form of price to the circuit based power environment. So again, we have the contractual ability to do that, and it's just a matter of whether we -- I do think it won't be like circuit power we're going to where we are going to get every bit of that path. So but I think that we'll look at that market-by-market and assess what the rate approaches."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jon Atkin . I was interested in xScale, and if you can maybe highlight any major differences with PGI and compared to GIC. And then more broadly as we sort of think about 2022 growth drivers for revenue -- revenue's margins CapEx, as well as AFFO, perhaps coming from xScale. But anything to keep in mind -- I know you're not going to give guidance on this call, but from a qualitative perspective, tailwinds and headwinds to keep in mind for next year. ."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Jon, on the other ones, I say want. Look, I haven't been -- I'm an optimist because I have never been, I guess on the business, how it's performing, what the magnitude of the opportunity ahead is. A little bit of noise in the quarter here, but I think that we had a -- we continue -- the business continues to perform. The fundamentals are very strong. 8,000 [Indiscernible] been added to add in the quarter, 3,000 billable cab ads, record bookings really for the past 3 quarters, at least seasonally adjusted in terms of this is our best Q3 ever. This quarter  degree predictability turn, as I said, at the low-end firm pricing, we added another quarter of positive pricing adjustments that Keith talked about in the script and continue to see good momentum on our new markets. And if you look at big markets that we're relatively earlier entering in in terms of -- think places like Mexico and now India. Huge opportunities in front of us there to over-indexing growth in those markets. And then digital services is really -- Our customers are responding really well to those products even though they're at an earlier stage growth. So I think as I look into 2022 in terms of headwinds, tailwinds, etc, feel really good about the bookings momentum, feel really good about the pricing in our relevance to customers and therefore our ability to support firm price points. A churn looks good, good deal mix is going to continue to be absolutely key to maintaining that. As I said, I think the headwinds more on making sure that we continue to -- we talked a little bit about power as a potential headwind there in some areas. We talked about, I think continuing to drive operational efficiencies in the business is going to be a key focus for us to drive operating leverage. And then continuing to work backlog. I think we've got a big backlog partially because we've got some big deals that have gone into that. We got to continue to work through that backlog, certain deal types, tab slightly longer book-to-bill. And I think we're seeing that as part of the complexity of implementing these more multi-vendor, hybrid multi-cloud kind of deals. And so we're continuing to sort of hone our capabilities there. So if we can continue to drive those things, I think we will be able to really take advantage of the bookings momentum that's there. And obviously, we'll give you a color on all of that as we go into the 2022 guide."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jon Atkin And then if I could th row 1 in on M&A, whether it's networking-related or software consolidation within the bare metal space, but anything kind of non-core to the classic data center business from an M&A tuck-in perspective, what --to what degree do you regularly look at those sorts of opportunities? And is there anything that you feel would sort of augment the platform from that perspective?"
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Yeah. A , Jon. I would say that we're continuing to learn in that area and we're accelerating our kind of investment of energy in the -- understanding that landscape. And at the same time we are -- we're still digesting and learning some of the business around digital services and how to adapt our approach and build capabilities both from -- evolved capabilities, both from a design and development perspective, as well as from a deployment and go-to-market perspective. And so we're continuing to honor our -- cut our teeth there and really learn those things in that ma rket. But I do think there are real opportunities there. And so we'll be continue to be active in that area in terms of looking at potential opportunities, both to add talent and technology and capabilities, and really learning that landscape better over the course of this year and next year and beyond."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Choe Hi, this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to ask about the strength in the America. It went from kind of a modest growth to now it seems like a very strong growth environment. What are you seeing there, and how long can the bookings continue?"
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Keith Taylor The other thing I would just say, Charles and Richard, remember this region's 75% utilized, so we have substantial amount of capacity that we have built and we continue to build in core markets. And the other thing I'd just -- as Charles alluded to, normally the focus that we have on the right customers, that our sales leadership team in the Americas and beyond are doing such a  job of selling the platform. And so the opportunity that we said -- that we talked about inter-region and intra -region is very real. So overall very optimistic about what we're seeing in the Americas region."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Choe And a quick follow-up turning, you see an issue in the Americas, are you seeing that lower now or has that not changed as much."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Well, I mean, I think it was -- I guess you'd have to obviously, you've been in the story for a long time, Richard has been, but I think there was a period of time when we had elevated churn associated with really honing our customer mix and our core competitive advantages and making sure that we were focused on those that would say that was back in the early days I was here in the 2011-12 time frame, when we really set about honing our sales process and driving er deal commercial scrutiny, etc. And I think that -- so we had a little bit of elevated turn as we work through that process. And then we had a little bit during the period of time when we digested some of the Verizon assets. We talked about the fact that we're a few -- several quarters ago, where we had deals that candidly just we're outside of the traditional sweet spot that we would be focused on. And I think it's the right long-term value creating decision for us to let those kind of things go and use that space and net capacity for advancing the strategy that we're really focused on. And so now, you're seeing that, and as I've always said, the most -- the best -- the best way to avoid losing a deal is to get the right deal in the door to begin with, and so that's what our focus is. I think our sales teams are really doing an exceptional job on that. Our new sales leader [Indiscernible] in the U.S. is just a dynamite sales leader doing an incredible job, and he's got a  leadership team across the board there. And so I got to give some credit [Indiscernible] to our [Indiscernible] in America. It's just a  team really driving that thing."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Guarino . Hey, Charles. Can you elaborate on your comments about pricing being firm? What exactly does firm mean and maybe specifically, if that's renewals or new leases? And then also, maybe just helpful would be if you could put some data behind it on the MRR per cabinet in the U.S. Could you tell us what that was, excluding the large footprint deployments this quarter?"
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Sure. I mean, when we say firm pricing, one of the bi g things we've talked about it is when we had net positive pricing actions in the quarter. So we essentially take what we're getting in terms of uplifts on our pricing accelerators if you will increase -- price increases that are contractually built in. We offset that against any potential downward movement that might occur on a release. Our business tends to move it a little bit of a saucy within that. It's -- we'll see these price escalators over kind of 3 to 5-year contract. We'll get a renewal that might have some summary rates. And then, we will kind of go through that cycle again. But in any given quarter, we're seeing those positive pricing -- overall positive pricing adjustments. And that's just, I think, a reflection of our ability to sustain those higher price points. As you can see in the Americas, actually in all of the world, we've been sort of moving MRR per cab up into the right for a long period of time. We've seen some really strong moving in EMEA over the last couple of years because of the interconnection price increasing. I think we were slightly down in the U.S. on a constant currency basis, but that often and depend on the t iming of installs and those kind of things, and so -- I mean, 23.93 per cab is just an exceptional number. And so I think if you look at that relative to the rest of the industry, I think you would find it to be sort of far, far away, but the best kind of yield in the industry itself. And so in terms of normalizing that for large footprint, we really aren't doing any really large footprint in the U.S. We occasionally will do an anchor deal in a facility, but we're not really active in the hyperscale or xScale space in the U.S. And we've talked about why that is in the past. And if you look at -- even in the other markets, we're doing that now almost strictly through the xScale business and through the joint venture. And so, that's not rolling in to the results that you see here, that really only rolls into our core financials in the form of fees and other things that we think are quite creative to the overall financial picture. So that's kind of picture on pricing. Pricing, I think on xScale continues to be competitive certainly, which is why returns in that business are a little lower but that's also why we decided to go do this through joint ventures where 80% of that capital is through a financial partner."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Guarino Okay. And then maybe just one clarification too on the stabilized revenue growth at the low-end factory of 5% range and I know Keith said it's going to step up again next quarter, but would the drag this quarter just due to a timing of commencement on leases?"
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Keith Taylor Could you repeat that? Is a drag, the timing of what?"
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,David Guarino Of commencements on leases was it just certain leases got push into next quarter? I guess if we're going to get to the high-end of the guidance rates. I would assume you have a pretty big step-up in near revenue growth. So I was wondering if there was something driving it or just a lease has got pushed into Q4 in terms of when you will start realizing revenue?
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Keith Taylor Well, first and foremost, as Charles alluded to in the end, we will -- just an outstanding quarter again from a bookings perspective. And more particularly in the Americas region. And as we just sort of talked about, the Americas enjoy the highest pricing environment. So there's a number of things that are going on. Part of it is sure timing, but it is also the conversion of our backlog into a billable cabinet that will make a big difference here. And so, there's nothing that I would say overly extraordinary other than we're just seeing overall momentum of the business continues to scale. Churn starting as abated or is abating, and then you've got a good price point with your inventory. This way we could be booked, sorry, netbook. Go from backlog into a billing item."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Simon Flannery , .  a lot. just coming back to the inflation and supply chain commentary. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the construction and the development side of things, availability of labor, raw materials? What's going on in the various markets around the world at both in terms of costs and your ability to pass that along as well as any impacts on timelines for development, and then you've been very active on the xScale, but in terms of other M&A, how are you thinking about the landscape out there or is this going to be more focused on sort of small tuck-ins from here, ."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Sure. So I'd start by saying that generally, I think our team has done a just an exceptional job navigating the current realities as it relates to supply chain around the world that our bottom-line message has been and continues to be that we really aren't seeing any meaningful negative impacts to our business. But that doesn't just magically happen. It happens by our team doing really  work to go and make sure that we are mitigating the risks that are out there. The way I -- Chuck, we talked about it internally is really 4 kind of levels to the supply chain potential risks. The first one is really facility level or in other words, are there -- are those constraints out there impacting our ability to deliver projects on time and on budget? And while we've seen some modest level of delays on a few projects, those are typically actually more associated with COVID delays and they are supply-chain candidly. As Keith noted in his script, we've actually taken on some inventory or contractual forward commits to the tune of about a $100 million, that is giving us the confidence to be able to make sure that we can deliver our projects on time. That combined with the fact that we've got a huge number of projects underway. And they are all over the world and we can move separate around. Typically, it's fundable between sort of projects. And so the team, the construction team, the procurement team, the sourcing team have just done a phenomenal job in terms of mitigating that, in terms of IBX availability and the delivery timelines. The next level on -- is really at the services level. In other words, our underlying services check there. Our network-related services like Fabric, Connect, etc. and Metal are we -- do we have the capacity to support the forecast there? And what we've done there is we've just forward purchased several quarters of capacity to give us the confidence that we can support that. And so feeling good about that as well. The third level is really deployment level. In other words, cage materials and other things that are needed as people build out their cages. We've also stockpiled there. Occasionally, there are circumstances where people have non-standard items that caused delays. But if they're sticking within the middle of the bell curve in terms of what their needs are, we're not seeing delays there. And then customer level delays is sort of the last level, which is our customers delayed in terms of getting their IT equipment to loan into deployments. And if not, are they delaying or asking for delays for commencement and those kind of things? And again, while we've seen a few of tho se things, they just -- in the grand seal -- scope of things and in the scale of our business are just not particularly meaningful. So there's some, there's probably a little bit of pressure on costs in some areas. We've been able to take advantage of our scale and I think to mitigate that, we're continuing to -- people often asked the question as to whether cost to build as inflationary or not, I would tell you that I think we've been able to keep up with it from a design standpoint and continuing to optimize our designs faster than costs are going up, so we're trying to keep ahead of the game there, but I think our team has done a really terrific job of managing those things. And I do think that we're -- we expect that things will start to stabilize over the course of 2022 from a supply chain perspective. So long answer there, but hopefully that gives you some perspective."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers I'm sorry, from an M&A perspective, I would say we are -- we continue to think there's opportunity out there, I mean, we talked -- I think John asked question about M&A in the -- in sort of the digital services side on the business. But there's also, we think continued opportunity in terms of extending our reach and looking for critical assets in the market that might be accretive to our strategy. And so, and we've got the balance sheet, the firepower to go after those kinds of things. And so we will continue to be active as appropriate. They're always with a high degree of certainty on getting the right deals."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Rollins  and . Curious for 2 questions. The first one is when you look at what's happening on the network side for network customers, are you seeing an increasing amount of telecom and wireless companies place their core network infrastructure in your facilities, rather than having their own mobile switching offices that it might have had it in the more legacy years of the telecom landscape? And what kind of opportunity that is for you as you -- if you look at wireless and 5G trying to take more services to the edge? And then, the second question is, what do you make of the tower companies investing in datacenter assets? And do you believe that your datacenter business, as well as power portfolios are destined to be partners, or maybe someday fall under the same ownership structure as you look out into the future."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Erik Rasmussen s. So getting back to xScale, you've obviously made a lot of progress in Europe and APAC thus far. And recently announcing another JV partner in Australia. But I guess circling back at what point the Americas become more interesting. As you look to expand the xScale, are you seeing any characteristics that are starting to get more exciting  about this market than what you're seeing elsewhere or recent in the same scenario?"
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Well, I think that when people start cutting each others throats on pricing. It will be real hard. It's not -- I mean, it's still a very competitive market, I think. And so I think that's different in terms of if you look at the broad Americas because I think there is opportunities in last and for us. Obviously, we already announced projects in Brazil I think we bring certain different, some very distinctive advantages there. I do think there is a ton of demand and as we've always said, we're not, we're not going to say we're religiously out of the business of doing that, but I think it would have to be under a special set of circumstances in terms of why we think that fits with the strategy. Because we're -- a strategy as you'll recall, is that we wanted to use those as opportunities to further our position in the cloud ecosystem, continue to invest in the relationship with the major cloud service providers, and broader set of hyperscalers and use that to create this advantage overall position in cloud ecosystem. We feel very good about our position, particularly in the U.S., and whether or not the xScale would be particularly accretive to that, I think is an open question. But we're not -- we're definitely not -- it's not out of the question that we would do that. I just think it's -- I think right now there are a lot of opportunities for us in other markets that we think are more attractive."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Erik Rasmussen Okay. and maybe just my follow-up, the Americas was strong once again, this quarter, would you characterize that most of the strength is coming maybe from Bell Canada or is it other factors that you can comment on as it relates to the strength in that region."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Keith Taylor Well, there was a reference in the prepared remarks just to talk about Canadian business is better than our -- it's doing better than we originally anticipating. Good on the team, and they're also selling global platform out of Canada into our other assets around the world. As it specifically relates to the Americas business, I think it's very good back to some of the fundamentals that Charles alluded to. We're targeting the right customers with the right applications and putting in the right places. And at the same, by the same token, we've got an inventory set that they really caters to a diverse set of customers across, across the U.S. or the Americas as a whole. And so between the assets we serve, the customers we target, and the delivery of services that are additive to co-location interconnection, I just think we're in a much better space. Our position and as a result, we are going to win more than our fair share of the businesses out there."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Colby Synesael Charles, in response to Jon Atkin 's question regarding your outlook on 2022, my take from your response was the top-line next sign that you're concerned is around margins, whether it's operational efficiencies or in particular power costs. And as it relates to the question around power costs, I feel you may have created more questions than answers so far in this call. And I'd love to get a little bit more detail. Specifically, you guys, I think had talked about your Analyst Day in June, seeing margins go up just modestly in 2022. I'm curious if you still think that that's possible. Secondly, you mentioned that you hedge an unregulated markets around 85%. How far out are those hedges? Does it seems like you're suggesting that you're okay with power costs going into 2022, but not necessarily for the full year. And then as it relates to the potential impact of power, do you think at the end of the day this could be up 25 basis point impact, 50 basis point impact, hundreds of basis point impact, just anything that gives us a better sense because my concern personally, is that we could now be in a situation where margins go down in 2022. And then just lastly, as it relates to AFFO, it looks like AFFO guidance implies a pretty meaningful step-down in the fourth quarter. Is that just the maintenance CapEx components that you talked about, Keith? Or is there something else there? And what's the better jump off point as we look to go to in 2022? Is it the third quarter? Or is it the fourth-quarter? ."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Keith Taylor And so Colby I just wanted to go back to again a couple of other questions. So there's 2 things that I felt I heard you ask.1. is what's happening quarter-over-quarter.  What's going on in Q4? And there was a reference that we made and that we accelerated some costs into this year, so that's number one both from our recurring CapEx perspective and some operating spend. And we did that for a number of reasons, and part of it is supply chain specific. The other part is we alluded to in the prepared remarks. When you look at AFFO in and of itself, Q4 is historically one of our lower performing AFFO quarters. That's why we don't guide on a quarterly basis, we gave you the annual number and say, this is what we will do, and we recognize things will move around, but the reality is Q4 always tends to be a higher recurring CapEx quarter, and that's what you're seeing in the guide that we've delivered at a $193 million at midpoint. So it gives you a real sense. It's a big step-up in our recurring CapEx for Q4. The other thing is, as we have said, that we have had a lot of success in the business and as a result, the cash payout attributed to commissions that is more substantial than we originally anticipated in Q4, and that's reflected in the guidance. And that's AFFO impacting on EBITDA impacting it, so there's a lot of nuances. But overall, when you look at the fundamental business, it's performed better than we anticipated. For every single quarter of the year, we're delivering against the expectations we have set. And as you -- I think, you know well that we based our guide both on revenue EBITDA and AFFO throughout the year. And we're at a point now where we feel comfortable and now we're focusing on 2022. And that's where the energy of the business is again focused on."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Frank Louthan About the [Indiscernible]America has been a tougher market last year. What sort of changed there, and how long do you think you can continue to see some better results out of those markets? ."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Hey, Frank. Yes, as I said earlier, I think that business has a strong trajectory. I think we expect that to continue, we don't see this as a temporary improvement. I think we're as a business, moving in a very solid direction. Strong demand from customers, good sales execution, and again we don't expect that -- and again, churn mitigating, getting the right customers right deals. I think that will continue to drive strong performance from that region. Which, obviously, is a pretty major driver of our overall performance."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Frank Louthan Given, it can -- we expect this to be a little bit of a new baseline and kind of continue to grow from here, or how should we think about the current trend."
4465222,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,11/4/2021,CEO Charles Meyers On Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Charles Meyers Yeah, I think as to whether it really accelerates, I think we have to continue to look at our success in driving new services revenues and what the rate of new customer capture and attaches and those kind of things. But again, I think we feel really good about where the business is right now and feel like that's a sustainable growth rate for us."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Darrin Peller  guys. It's  to see the macro recovery and you guy’s benefiting there, as well as the initiatives you've made, especially on the Corpay side. And I just want to hone in on that segment for a minute, given all the acquisitions and the re-branding and the efforts on sales focused on software now, so can you just touch on that in terms of what the different assets are going to contribute? Where you saw the opportunity for growth most profound in the next few quarters? And then, maybe just quickly, I saw in the quarter, we were hoping for a little more acceleration now, but, I think, some of this may be coming over time as the sales force re-navigates its focus. But, can you just touch on the current trends? I think it decelerated on a 2-year stack a little bit, but what it could be going forward. ."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Hey, it's Ron her e. We're pretty happy with it. I'd say the sales continue to remain quite good in the corporate pay segment, and of the 3 areas, our direct business where we go to end clients and our FX business cross-border business, super-good growth in Q3. I think one was the -- direct businesses was 30%. I think it's in the earnings supplement and the cross-border I think high teens, 19. All the while, we're digesting that AFEX acquisitions are pretty busy on that."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke So I think those two pieces are basically 90% of the business. And so they're growing good, the sales are good. To your point, if we get any COVID recovery, there's still some fair amount to get back next year. We're -- I think we're bullish. I think our early view again is high teens for that segment for '22."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Darrin Peller Okay. That's really helpful. And just Ron, this is -- should we think about it being much more of a software-focused approach going forward in terms of sales versus more pure-play virtual card, I guess, more rolled on -- rolling together all the assets?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yes, that's a . Yes. We started -- I think, a couple of years ago, we bought the full AP software front end and plugged it into our back-end execution stuff. And so we moved the mix, Darrin, dramatically, here in 2021, so we're selling, I think, almost 2 [Indiscernible] what we call full AP when we take 100% of the client's payables versus virtual card. But obviously the  news is, it's still all virtual card. When we sell that full AP underneath that basically, it's the same engine to your point, the same merchant database, the same ability to earn interchange if you will on that portion so it sells better we think, it has more value to the client. We generally retain more of the economics there, and yet we still have a bunch of virtual cards. You'll see more of that. I think will probably move you in more of the business as you roll forward that way."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Andrew Jeffrey Hi. . Appreciate you taking the time. Ron, the commentary on the digital go-to-market, I think, is particularly intriguing. Can you talk a little bit about what the LTV to CAC looks like in your fuel business? I think you said 50% of sales are going through digital channels. And how we might expect that to inform your consolidated profitability over time?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yes, I think the call-out, Andrew, was for our whole global -- our entire sales for Q3, we run around 65% --"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Charles Freund Andrew, I'd just like to clarify -- this is Charles. I'd just like to clarify Ron's comment regarding 65% in terms of an acquisition cost. We define that as what we call NSE or net sales expense. It's basically cost of acquisition divided by the annual revenue from that client for prospect. If someone's going to generate $1,000 on revenue for me annually and it cost me $650 to acquire that account, that's the 65% metric that we use internally."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,Andrew Jeffrey Okay. And how does that compare to the traditional sales channels?
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yeah, Andrew, I [Indiscernible] laid on it because lots of other people spend lots of money. They generate some sales, but you can't ever make a return, right? So if you sold 100 million and spend 65, your under water the first year, but then you've got, call it 90 million, of the 100 you sold the second year with 80% flow-through, you got 80 billion flowing through for 8 more years with no sales expense. That's -- the key to profitability in our business is basically, this acquisition costs and the retention rate. We call it out because that's how the business actually makes money."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Pete Christiansen .  guys. Just wanted to dig a little bit into the lodging business this quarter. I know it was a bunch of natural disasters in the last couple of months. Wildfires, iLab (ph), so on and so forth. Just wondering to what degree that was -- that contribution factor to some out-sized growth the lodging. How should we think about the ALE business during periods of natural disasters? How does that business from a revenue perspective, how should we think about it ranging in these types of periods? ."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Hey, Pete, , it's Ron. On the first part of the question, how did bad weather and stuff help the lodging business in Q3? Some is the answer. We pick up some decent amount of incremental volume when that happens, almost unexpected volume, but the rate on that's super-duper low. We're signed up with contracts with people like FEMA and stuff. And so lots of volume and a little bit of revenue contribution. On the ALE side, I'd say, it helps again, a little bit. The diligence that we did on that business is surprisingly over incredibly long cycle, I don't know 90% plus, I guess, over the 5 or 10 years we looked at, is not hurricane or natural disaster related. It's, your pipe breaks, and your house floods. And you let the candle on in the bathroom and the house burned down. What we think of is way more common, everyday, which is why we went ahead with the business. It's way more ratable. You take all the hundreds of millions of homes or apartments. Stuff goes wrong with them that displace people, and that business, obviously, the insurance, so the statistics on it are pretty good. I'd say for both businesses, it helps really just at the margin."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Pete Christiansen That's helpful. And then, your comments on the fuel card business, seeing a little bit of incremental softness, which is understandable with what's going on abroad in some areas. But I was wondering if you characterized the competitive market, perhaps for larger fleet type deals, and how that's evolving as we come out of COVID? Are you seeing competition intensify or are there big opportunities ahead, do you think? Wondering if you could put a frame on that? "
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke I'd say probably, if anything, it's lessened during COVID. I think, we called out for at least a few quarters now, the overall fuel card retention rate, which is up. I think it's up. I don't have it in front of me, but it's certainly up dramatically in the last couple of years versus where it was a couple of years ago, and I think I called out that it remained at 93% for the quarter. And so I would say the COVID basically, people shifted to other priorities and doing RFP s for fuel cards probably wasn't the top one. The other thing I'd say because I think it's misunderstood is, the real competition for us, we study wind, winds and losses in fuel cards. So where do we get the 35,000 new accounts that came on board this quarter and where the 10,000 that we lost? And the answer is not our friends WEX, it's basically business cards and other forms of payment, mostly business cards, for example. So that's -- so the real competition for us globally in the fuel card business is really other means of payment."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Ramsey El-Assal Hi, gentlemen.  for taking my question tonight. I wanted to ask about the new sales bookings growth, which was an impressive number. Was this the result of any changes you've made and your approach in terms of the sales organization? And also, could you help us think through, or even remind us, of the algorithm by which those bookings will eventually convert to revenue and maybe something about timing or how that actually operates?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yeah Ramsey. We agree. I tried to put a bit of a spotlight on it for the quarter because it's in record territory. There weren't 50,000 accounts till I started with the platform 20 years ago. To sign up 50,000 new businesses in a quarter is good. And then second, against the '19 baseline, I think I called out, our bookings dollars were up 30%. So forget the weak comp against the normal quarter a couple of years ago. It's way up, so they headline is our Company's sales are way up. That's headline one. And partly is why they are way up? I think, it's the rotation we made into digital. Start, I don't know, 4 or 5 years ago, we did a bunch of things to get way better at digital mark eting and selling, obviously. Not the least of which is the whole tech stack that we build to be able to follow businesses and everywhere they crawl around and then what they do to advertising, figuring out where to spend and who to the target money against to get them to visit our sites to optimizing our sites, to get conversional rates and sales out the bottom end to applications going end-to-end where someone could go on our site and literally order the program and get cards in a couple of days and not have to talk to people. The re-engineering I'd say of the whole digital machinery has been -- first of all it was an asset, but we're getting the returns of it now. It's obviously ramped way the heck up, and I think it's another huge step up in our early plans for '22. So I would say that's the main, main driver. And we're doing that everywhere. We're just way smarter in how we target and how we study where prospects go, what they're looking at instead of trying to make up who we think might be interested in our products. On your second question on bookings, the answer to it is, let's say we said we've sold, picking up $100 million of new business in this quarter. To Chuck 's point, what that means is, as you roll forward and that all gets implemented, it's obviously an annualized amount of 100. It wouldn't be 100 in this year like we saw it throughout the year, it'd be 50, for example, in that case. And so we have very different timings in our Brazil business. We sell and it's almost instamatic. In our fuel card business we sell and we get it pretty soon. In our corporate payments businesses, which are bigger accounts, it takes longer. We, basically, know our sales, if you will. Our new business for '22 because it's all sitting in our pipeline to be implemented. The bookings number turns into an annualized revenue number, which is how we build our plan. And then, the timing, or what we call the in-year amount, varies across the various businesses we have. But the main thing I want to make sure people are clear, is it's working. I don't want to get lost in the details here, that the Company -- our Company is selling more of everything than it's ever sold before. Ever."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Ramsey El-Assal . Sounds like it's not a fluke, but by design. So that's encouraging. Ron, I wanted to ask you about your new compensation contract, which is structured in more of a pay-for-performance style. Can you talk about why you pivoted in that direction in terms of structuring your confidence? What gives you confidence about hitting those sort of future hurdle rates?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yeah, that's an interesting question. I'd say, basically, that the first 10 years of the Company's life was in a PE form, where the alignment between investors and managers were super-clear. The value gets created, the proceeds get split versus this, kind of, hey, I just give you money for showing up and so -- it's in the DNA. I like it. I like if the people that put capital in alongside of me get returns and I get returns, and if we don't, we don't. And obviously, there's more leverage in that. I've got off, as you know, a lot of money, and so getting some money with our current tax structure is not super interesting. So it's a motivating way to keep me at the grindstone for a couple of years here to try to get the thing to the -- to a place. And how do I feel about the confidence other than the way people trade our stock? I feel good. We have models that come off of this sales and retention math that we run all the time through your models. And I see what the revenue and cash EPS looks like running through our machine. And if it's valued fairly, reasonably, it gets to those targets that are there. So I look at it and go if it is somewhere priced our earnings reasonably, I think we can make the targets and then I can get paid."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Mihir Mehta , and  for taking my question. To start, I wanted to ask about the gift card business. Given all we're hearing about supply chain issues, could that be a tailwind? You're in 4Q, maybe a little bit of a unique opportunity there. Anything you're hearing? If you could talk about that?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yeah, Mihir, it's Ron's again. Yeah, there are a bit on the card side and the retailers ordering cycle. I would say it looks like it's going to come in on our plan, but I was talking to our gift heads not long ago. But I'd say, the upside fo r us is probably, not so much that the card orders would go up, it is really we're finally the guy running it and we finally found a way to grow the business and how along you've followed our Company. But I've been trying to sell the business since I bought it, and all of a sudden, the guys turned it into a business now that we think can compound a double digit. So the way they've done it is instead it just being an administrator or an account for the Macy's gift card and count $100 down, they help our clients now sell online. So they've moved over to helping sell online digital gift cards because they know a lot about it. They've -- they're getting paid extra for wallet provisioning. Half the gift cards, there's breakage where people can't find them anymore. They're in a drawer. And so super technically hard to move private label cards in the wallet. But our guys came up with a way to do it. So we're getting paid money from a number of the brands to basically provision those electronically. And then the guy came up with the idea of selling the content we have 300 or 400 pretty good brands were so we're taking a back to businesses because we're the B2B business, so they built a bit of a revenue and sales stream now, taking them for rewards to like companies like ours, for example, for employees. So these two or three new ideas on top of the old chugging along low single-digit business has propped that thing up now to be north of 10%. I went through the guys plan a couple of weeks ago, so I think we finally have a set of ideas that are more sustainable to keep rolli ng that business now."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Mihir Mehta All right. . And then -- if I could ask about the -- just about Brazil. You mentioned things are getting back to normal there. You've obviously had very good momentum in selling more tags. Is there argument there that you might see a little bit of exponential step function growth in the revenues per tag? Because those are still meaningfully below where you were in 2019. You've obviously added a lot of capability, as where you can use those tags too."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yeah, that must be -- you're looking at that the FX so we're way to heck up. The sales there in constant currency, and [Indiscernible] are way, way up. I don't have it in front of me versus '19, Chuck's going to pull it up, but vis -a - vis record levels, whatever we sold in Q3 would've been an all-time record number of sales. And what I said about the recovery is, Brazil was in a complete ditch COVID-wise in the spring and into the summer. And somehow has come out the other side. They're in a better place than we are here. So what's that's done is, it's opened the stores there where we sell a lot, we have kiosks, and hundreds and hundreds of stores. Stores are open, people are walking, mobility is back, and so more people are running through the tolls where we also sell. So the places basically where we conducted just to try to make sales are kind of reactivated again, which is helping drive it. And then second, I think we 've said before, we've come up with a number of super-new partner or channel ideas there. The newest one is we've got a couple of the big car manufacturers to put the tags now on the vehicles. So when you go in and get your new Volkswagen and drive it out of the dealership there, you look up and there's a sticker already there with a little POS thing that says call this number or go to this website. We're getting 50% or some conversion on adoption of these new vehicles rolling out of the dealerships. So it's really -- I can't even tell you how good of a sales story that team has put together. But as you said, the big, big idea for us, and we poured a lot of capital into it, this year in '21, is to double or triple the fueling locations. And the fueling transactions were up huge over a year ago now, as we take the 6 million vehicles that we had tags and give more places to use the tags. So that's the one that you said to me, where could the free money and real acceleration come? It could come from this massive group of people, basically just having more places to use the tag and the account that's already on their vehicle."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,Mihir Mehta Right. And you get paid per transaction right? I .
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke We get pay the MDR -- pretty attractive MDR on the fueling in that example, yes."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Sanjay Sakhrani . I wanted to talk about the partner-channel, corporate payments, Mr. Charles touched on. When we think about that 13%, 14%, is this a higher profitability contribution? Because your partners is sort of bearing the expense. And then as we think about how that percentage is going to migrate over time, do you expect that to go up or down, or are there -- how long are those partners committed to? ."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yes. It's Ron. Let me start with the second part. We probably have, I don't know, 15 significant kinds of partners in that corporate payments group, our top 3 or 4 most important, another 8 or 10. And the contracts, generally, would run anywhere from, probably, 3-5 years. We just renewed, actually, a couple of them with some of our most important partners this year. In terms of what do I think, I'd say down, would be my answer. If you look at, I think, we put [Indiscernible] in the earnings supplement, I think it's Page 15."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Take the 3 pieces of our corporate payments business: the partner thing that we're talking about, and then the direct business where we go to the end client, and then the cross-border business where we mostly go to the end client. You can see that those two are growing revenue much faster, and so the mix itself, if these ran the clock forward, would make the partner piece smaller, I think, going forward. So obviously, there's lots of spend there and spend grows fast. But to your point, they do more of the work, so obviously, our rates are much, much lower there than in the direct business. So we like the business, but obviously 90% of our corporate payments business is in the directed cross-border."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Sanjay Sakhrani I guess obviously the chatter out there is you have a lot of these Fintechs that are competing against you, and with you. I'm just curious, as we think about FLEETCOR 's competitive edge. I know, Ron, you talked about how you're putting the acquisitions together to deliver a powerful punch. But do you feel like there's -- the competitive intensity has increased in that market and you're -- or that you've widened your moat in that market? I'm just curious to just get a little more color on that because that's obviously been a hot topic of discussion."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke I think it's a super . I think, obviously, there are more people trying to get into card processing, whether it's virtual or just traditional physical cards. I think, first off, that a lot of the players are getting into it, are more issue for issuing kinds of companies that are in that business. For FIs and for us, but yes, some of them are coming into our area. What I'd say back is, the fallacy is somehow that the game is tech and product. That, oh, the XYZ's Fintech has some  thing, knock old fashioned FLEETCOR out of it. And so what I say is, what they're missing is, it's the merchant network. You can't monetize virtual cards if you don't have a virtual card merchant network that can process and capture those transactions you can process till the day goes on, but you have to have the network. So we've had a 10-year head-start on everybody and cleansing, building, growing that network. And then the second one is the whole service dimension of a huge pay-for-you group, a massive group that helps the partners clean up the data and get the stock processed. So I think those would be the couple of components that people miss that this isn't just making a new processing engine in the garage and given it to AWS and it's all going to be . There are actual real assets that we have. The cars are partners to stay with us. I mean, there was a big thing, so I won't give it my outgoing here. Two of your clients, Bill.com and Avid abroad, another providers. We're doing  with them. We've renewed the contract for a number of years with one of them. We're getting more business than ever from another. We're obviously have a  relationship. Some of those are targeted, like, the Marquette thing, as an example of targeted FI's, which we're not even and we're not in the processing business to help FI's. We thought they won't use their own processors and stuff. I think like everything else, it's someone searches for some narrative that isn't there. We've got a good business, it's growing, it's funds grow like crazy, but because we make so much more money on the direct businesses, and they're growing fast, that mix will cause the partner thing to be a bit smaller. But I think we're still -- I tell you, go call the partners. Don't ask me the supplier. Go ask our partners if they like the job we're doing. I look at the performance reports, I sit in performance reviews with the partners myself, personally, so from my vantage point, we're doing quite well."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Suchoski Hi,  everyone. . I just wanted to dig into the fuel card business a little bit more. It looks like transactions came in weaker than we were expecting. And I think, you called out international and the driver shortage. But can you provide some detail there on where you're seeing that weakness on the transaction side and what's your expectation around the recovery?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Ken, hey, it's Ron. Yes, I'd say that there's good news and bad news. The good news is -- the bad news is that the transactions are a little weaker than we thought, the good news is they're not worth much. The two areas of weakness are in trucking again, and particularly large trucking both here and in Europe. And you guys have read the press on this, that the large trucking firms just don't have drivers, and not only are there not drivers, they're quitting and forming and going into smaller firms now. So our big accounts are effectively just soft in terms of trucks and transactions, but they're happy because they're just raising their rates. And then, the second one, I would say is really Europe. There's a big corporate sales of white collar. Book of business where people haven't gone back to work in Europe. I don't know if you guys know this, but in Europe, lots of people have Company cars. People like us have a car, we're used to drive around and get reimbursed. Those are the 2 areas that are weak. The good news is we don't get paid anything for those things. We don't get paid very much. That's why our revenue growth is still pretty good. The local business for example, our partner business are super healthy and even a big part of our U.K. business, which I'm looking at, had strong same-store sales recovery. The areas where we get paid and we get revenue are actually pretty healthy."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Suchoski Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe for my follow-up, I think on last quarter's call, you provided some preliminary thoughts on '22. I think, you talked about $14 in annualized EPS in the second half of this year. Yeah, some interest rate hedges rolling off, and then, the contribution from AFEX and ALE. Lots of moving parts, but maybe you can frame for us how you're thinking about 2022?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yeah, that's -- it's a . The way -- I say this all the time, if you like businesses, you can plan. You should like our business, it's the nature of the model. And so what we do is, we -- which we're about halfway through, we build things off of run rates. So we're staring here at October volumes and revenues in all of our businesses. And I think what I said is, hey, when you post 352 or 350, we multiply it and we go, okay, that sounds like 14, and we guide it to a number -- I don't have it in front of me to check this, 350 something for Q4, which is track stuff. So there's another one. So hey, we start with, the Company is running earnings 14 box on an annualized basis now, then we sit there and say, okay, we had sales record level this year of which, call it 2/3 of that will be realized in 2022 so we can see what that number is. Then we have a bigger sales plan for 2022, probably 20% higher, and we look at what's in year there, I'm like, okay, that looks good. And then we look at the deals that I mention ed that are on top of that, which I think I called out together, I called $0.50 would be my commitment on the stuff that we use capital for us. That's how we build the math. We take the run rate, we take this year and next year sales, we take added things like the accretion of [Indiscernible], and that helps us, basically target a number that we can get to. And we haven't planned a heck of a lot of COVID recovery. Obviously, it's been the weirdest, obviously, 12 months this year. and so we've been pretty conservative so far and getting some of that back, we still have probably $100, $150 million that could literally come back a different day, potentially. And those are the components. And what I was trying to say -- and the other one is the macro, obviously, fuel prices are higher here in November than they were in January, and seem to be holding. And so when you roll all that up, my messages are, it looks super early, but it looks like a really good number. And the reason I go through all that math is to get people, other than us who run the Company, some insight into how they ought to think about it. That things could happen, but that the Company is pretty well-positioned to put up an attractive growth number for next year."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"David Togut . In the corporate payments business, WEX reported a pretty substantial compression in revenue yields in the third quarter year-over-year. Can you comment on the revenue yield you're seeing in that business? And A. Is there any significant change and are there any call outs and verticals, i.e. travel versus non-travel?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Okay. David, it's Ron. Honestly, it's a , so I go back to the slide that [Indiscernible] would in our earnings supplement. I think it's page 15. So again, sitting inside our corporate payments business, I think we reported 22% organic growth and 50% of some trends for the quarter? The [Indiscernible]. Obviously that's the overall number, David. But the pieces of that again, are the director or end client business, the cross border business, and then this channel partner business. For us, the good news is the 2 big pieces which are about 90% of looking at the thing are effectively flat. Because we price it, there's really no rate erosion in that part of our business, and so all of the rate erosion is really just in the mix of partners, where we have tax cable rates and we have some partners that are growing like crazy. So, as their volumes go up they enjoy a bit better rates right in the base, than the base rates. So, because we don't have the same kind of reliance, if you will, on the channel business I think we're a bit more insulated, if you will, from rate compression there. And I mentioned it earlier, I'd say the super-positive thing is our mix of that business is going to more full AP. And don't forget, we bought up SMB Company that has higher rates. So as we roll in, the full AP, the Nvoicepay mix and this Corpay One mix, those have a way higher rate than the existing businesses. So my guess is just kicking out the channel business, I see actually rate expansion over the next couple of years, and that business mostly held for mix."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,David Togut Understood. That's very clear. Just as a quick follow-up. You commented earlier about the difficulty of finding drivers in this environment. Could you quantify for us what this means for your fuel card business in terms of revenue growth in 2022?
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yeah. Again, I think the driver thing is a total trucking vertical issue, David. I don't think it's -- we don't see it -- obviously, it's significantly in the trades businesses, right? [Indiscernible], those people have to be trained and whatever they ask. We don't see the same kind of sides, if you will, of our existing customers and those kinds of businesses. And so -- and again, we see it mostly in the large account trucking business, would be the other thing which we don't make any money in either. So I'd say that who knows? My guess is it's not a super - easy fix for suddenly large trucking people to get the people, although you see the pictures of the -- at the ports of the need for more trucking. So my guess is there will be more incentives and pressure to try to get more people into the space over the next 6 to 12 months. But I'd say it doesn't do much to us. 1. Its limited only t o that trucking vertical, 2. It's limited to the big firms which don't pay us much, and 3. Honestly, it's been our run rate, the softness has really been there for the last couple of quarters. And so I don't see it getting any worse, mostly because of what I said, that I think there's going to be such a push to try to add people, I think the rates are going to keep going up to attract people. I'd say it's probably not a super duper impact on our forward thinking for the fuel card business."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"George Mihalos Hey, guys,  for taking my questions and for squeezing me in here. Ron, you talked a lot about some of the, I guess, hiring and wage pressures that are impacting the fuel side of the business. I'm curious, as it relates to the corporate payments business, do you feel that's been impacted at all by any supply chain issues at your customers, or has that come up at all in your conversatio ns with them?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Yeah. For sure. Again, George, I'd say it's pocketed. When we go look, we have bigger customers there. And some have come through this thing unscathed, and then others have had big problems. Yes, we have a select group of clients that are down and have stayed down. And, I think, the supply chain is a big part of it."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"George Mihalos Okay. That's helpful. I'm just curious to the extent are you able to quantify that in any sort of capacity? Will give any sort of color around that? And then maybe separately for a follow-up, the minimal credit losses that you're continuing to see, is that just a harbinger of just cleaner credit now or, do you feel that there is an opportunity to loosen credit standards even from here? Just curious how you're thinking about that?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke I'll take the first part. Yes, we are. One of the easiest things to quantify for us is to look at clients we have. Let's say clients 1 through 100, and look at their volumes in revenue at [Indiscernible] period. Let's say 2019 or Q3 of 2019. And then let's say we still have those 100 clients to go look at their volume and revenue with us in Q3 of this year. That's the stat we call same-store sales or the core client - base. So, yes, we -- per corporate payments for every business, we turn that into a revenue number and say, okay, we're [Indiscernible], whatever $20 million with clients that used to give us $20 million more 2 quarters ago than they do now. And hey, we watch them to see whether some of that $20 million is coming back. We have super-clear visibility on the amount of it and the rate of recovery of it. Is that one clear?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"George Mihalos Yes. Curious if you could ballpark what that impact would be, or if you're willing to ballpark what that impact would have been? How much faster the growth would've been in the segment?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke It's about us just to give you a percentage it's about I'd say 3% this quarter versus our plans that we guesstimated those a 100 people would come back a certain way in Q3 from 2 years ago and they came part of the way back. They come back to where we thought they had 3 points more of growth in their thing. It's still a significant thing and we'd be hopeful maybe we get it back and be ready to get back a different day. On your second question, the credit question, I'd say yes, yes, and yes. It's a super-. It's record lifetime lows of credit losses. First of all, because we didn't sell much new business obviously in 2020, so there wasn't a lot of new business coming on. And then between the stimulus and relief and everything else, people repaid us and stuff. And so for sure, we've opened it up. I think Chuck said in the last call last time that we expect those losses to tick up, you see it a bit in the roll rates, as we've on boarded a lot more business this year. Our [Indiscernible] loses will be a bit higher, and we're actually, doing that juggling question now for 2022. Okay, how much do we -- how open do we want to be in credit, both with existing accounts in terms of credit lines. Think of this, I've got 500,000 fuel card clients that have some credit line. And the credit line's enough to pay their fuel card bills. What if they tell me they want to pay all my bills -- all their bills with me? I say, okay, I let you pay some with our credit. Our opportunity to increase credit to credit worthy people for our new products is super high. And I'd say, we for sure will re-balance next year, towards taking more risk, certainly, than this year and try to make that trade-off right between the incremental sales and revenue growth and incremental losses. But we'll be careful. I want to make sure everyone on the call is clear. We're not crazy. We'll step our way in, we'll study our way in, but we will do more of it."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Bob Napoli . , Ron and Jim and Chuck. So Ron, I mean, there's been a lot of questions asked and -- but just what business or what are you most excited about over the next few years? Which part of -- parts of your business do you see the most opportunity to maybe outperform, drive upside, drive growth?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ron Clarke Hey Bob, it's a . I'd say the most -- to me, the most exciting thing, which is coming mostly from the world out there is this synergy, this, this platform concept of bringing walk around plastic, which is the business we've mostly been in, with Payables together. And so it's a way of creating, in our case of massive synergy of these businesses we built over 20 years of getting just way more out of them. I gave the example earlier, we're launching late this month or at the beginning of December, this thing we call the two-in-one, where a client that has a business card of ours, or our fuel card, can also pay bills with us and literally would be in one place. He could use our card and our credit to pay some of his bills. Obviously, we'd have access [Indiscernible] his bank account to fund the bills. His report, which show all his walk-around purchases, like it does now, and it would show all his payables to vendors the way it is now, and it would all be in one place. And so that has the opportunity of joining up businesses that we have. That's what’s creates profit acceleration, where you don't have to go fish one at a time through each new client, you can go back to this pretty gigantic customer base that we built and basically start to join it up and cross-sell stuff that's useful to them. And the tech that we have now makes it look -- when you look at it, it's just stitched together now. So I'd say that that's the -- again, I tried to say in the thing, I'm also excited. I know people will doubt me -- doubt us, but we've got a lot of legs in the businesses. We have on that page we 've been just beyond thing and we've added segments everywhere in all the businesses which are adding growth. So I'm obviously super-happy about that, but this integration and joining up in synergy, where the new guys that have some nice new shiny product, they don't have a 20-year customer base and spend, and they don't get 50,000. Certainly the most of all your guys had sign up 50,000 clients in the quarter. So that's the super exciting thing, is, can we monetize this bigger business profitably, would be what I'd say is the super new opportunity for us."
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Bob Napoli . . And Charles, just how are you feeling looking at margins, the ability to expand margins from here over the next few years?"
4465233,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.",FLT,11/4/2021,CEO Ron Clarke on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Charles Freund Yeah, Bob, I'd say that our model tends to be one where we try to grow top-line, 10% plus and get a little bit of expansion. I think that is a mindset we've had for a long time and we'll continue on that path. I'd say we'll increment our way as we go. With that said, when do make a little room for select investments, whether it's the digital sales that Ron mentioned, when we find opportunities to invest, we will make those investments but always with a mindset, that we will continue to grow the bottom line a little bit faster than the top."

With room nights down 10% versus '19, Glenn, maybe you could go through what needs to happen from here to get above '19. What areas still need to come back strong and not just Asia, but your thoughts on that. And then David, maybe you could talk about core business margins versus '19. Let's ignore payments and take your trip for now. But how are you thinking of the puts and takes on the core business versus '19. ."
4465237,Booking Holdings Inc.,BKNG,11/4/2021,CEO Glenn Fogel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Goulden Yeah. So now, I [Indiscernible] as , we’d actually be [Indiscernible] relatively quick on the puts and takes in the core combination business. Our underlying take rates have been solid, and obviously, the reported take rates are a function of timing, so that continues to go well for us. As we get to -- back to 2019 levels, there will be some inflation refresher on the personnel line. Everybody knows there's a war for tech talents out there, and we've had two for years whether the merit increases in other expenses in -- other increases in our cost base. Of course, we did take expenses out, but there are variable expenses. So, they will come back with some efficiency over time, but there will be some pressure on the personnel line. But there are other things that are in the model that we can use to offset that pressure. We can get extra economy to scale as the business growth is beyond 2019 levels on both the fixed costs and on the variable cost side as well. There are opportunities in our direct mix, which of course is very important. And of course, a key element. And this will grow happens to off over ROIs. And on the front marketing side where we saw some increase in the first half of the year, we saw some small compression in the second-half of this year, but those markets are very variable and very dynamic, and we're pleased with how we're doing in those markets. The last thing I want to leave you with on that topic is that within our core business, there's always a trade-off between growth market share, and profitability. So, to the extent we see opportunities, we leaning in. We want to try and drive market share increases where we think that we can, that will pressure the business in the short-term as we lean into making those investments. And also, as the investment in marketing and other areas were basically be a leading indicated relative to revenue. So, there will -- we do believe that we're -- there are opportunities for us to gain share in accommodations through this -- the recovery and beyond. So that would be an additional factor in the mix and how we think about the long-term business margin in accommodations."

So, spend is going up a little. How much of that is Booking getting more aggressive as demand picks up versus a more competitive overall ad environment? And then compared to 2019 as distribution in brand and performance changed meaningfully. And lastly, can you give us an update on the kind of merchandising and promotion -- some of the merchandising promotion tests that you've done over the past couple of quarters? ."
4465237,Booking Holdings Inc.,BKNG,11/4/2021,CEO Glenn Fogel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Fogel Yeah. So, Kevin, obviously, merchandising is a very important reason why we built out, and are continuing to build-out, our payments platform in booking.com. Just making sure that we're able to compete and provide  value to our customers. And what's really important is not doing just out of our own pocket, but working with our partners, coming up with the right time to the right consumer, the right offer and helping them. Our supply partners, also provide some of that, let's say, added value. For example, we may do flash sales. You may hope or you've seen some. Hope you've gotten some, hope you actually booked some of them. That's an example. One of the things, for example, when somebody is getting in accommodation and we are able to offer them either lower cost or even free sometimes, right from the airport to the hotel. In a [Indiscernible], different variations that we can do with the different verticals in coming up with the best combination, trying to do as much as we can with our suppliers’ money, but sometimes using our own too to come up what really is an attractive offer. So, the consumer knows that when it come to our site, they're getting the best value, because value really is one of the key strategic objectives for us, always through providing that."

Q3 saw strong recovery across the geographies that we talked about. So, I'd say there's still a bias towards more leisure outdoor-oriented activity, particularly beach-oriented properties did very well in the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. But we do see some recovery into the cities as well, and I think this -- we all know that anecdotally, if you want to book a hotel room night in a city, it's becoming increasingly hard. So, we are seeing recovery across the board, although still more entry (ph.) towards the outdoor beach-oriented leisure locations."

Curious what your view is on how the landscape on both the supply and the demand side might evolve as we move into a post-pandemic world and aim towards summer of 2022, and how you think about making investments on supply to match up the way in which there might be a more normalized travel environment in '22.  so much."
4465237,Booking Holdings Inc.,BKNG,11/4/2021,CEO Glenn Fogel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Goulden That was good. I just point out that to your point, that does strengthen that balance in both clearly contributed to us having a strong Q3 because we saw strong demand in [Indiscernible] to continue that we saw sequentially, a much bigger increase from Q2 to Q3 in hotels that we could off the book."
4465237,Booking Holdings Inc.,BKNG,11/4/2021,CEO Glenn Fogel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Ju Okay.  so much. Glenn, I think in the past we've talked about your payment’s product helping to expand your term by their on-boarding those users who may not necessarily be using credit cards and instead online payment services. Given the overall, I guess, depressed state of travel in Asia, maybe much of that value of lock is still in front of us, but are you seeing evidence in other regions of the world that this is helping to bring in that incremental user? And also, just the rising ability for you guys to merchandise as you do more the Connected Trip, but -- opens up a er opportunity for you guys to run promos and change prices, enhance -- flex your gross margins up and down to drive growth on top of what has always been a more of a performance marketing-driven growth. So, is there still a pretty material gap in ROI from doing one versus the other at this point in terms of what you perceive?"
4465237,Booking Holdings Inc.,BKNG,11/4/2021,CEO Glenn Fogel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Goulden Sure, as Glenn said, payments is increasingly becoming heart of the core value proposition that we offer at booking.com in particular to both customers and partners. It's no longer just kind of we think as add-on, it really is solving problems for both all of them in cost-effective ways and risk reduction ways, they couldn't do as efficiently themselves. So as much as ROI is growing so rapidly, changing all that mix. Now, you're right, Steve. Once we're on payments, we can participate in merchandising. Of course, with the most efficient way to get rates, is to source  rates, which Glenn talked about, frame out additional lines. But if we need to participate over and above sourcing and driving promotional targeting particular users. and particular markets, we can with payments platform. And we now have enough experience under our belt, enough instrumentation around that, that we can treat that as you mentioned, as a marketing investment. And look at it in a very similar way to the way we look at spend in the performance channels for example, count, compare ROI s one versus the other, and decide what the right mix is. So correct, with payments becoming a bigger piece of all proposition, where we can, where we need to, where we think it makes sense. We can look our merchandising through a strong ROI [Indiscernible]. We can be quite proactive in that area and compare it directly with other forms of spending and marketing."
4465237,Booking Holdings Inc.,BKNG,11/4/2021,CEO Glenn Fogel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Anmuth s. I just wanted to ask about social advertising and if the dollars there are still small, but just curious what gives you the confidence and that working to the point of potentially adding some real dollars there? It's an area you've tried before, so just curious kind of what's different now? And then secondly, David, if you could just walk through those 4Q sequential revenue dynamics again, and if there's something that's particularly different, as opposed to just the normal seasonality? ."
4465237,Booking Holdings Inc.,BKNG,11/4/2021,CEO Glenn Fogel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Goulden Yeah. Doug, let me explain that -- re-explain that whole seasonality thing because this is quite important than we can explain it high level. So Q3 was very strong. It was always artificially strong from a revenue for me because you've got two things naturally healthy it. First of all, remember a lot of bookings in Q1, Q2 that we're always stay in Q1, Q2 stayed in Q3. So, we got that benefit compared to the normal Q3. On top of that, in the quarter, more bookings in Q3, the normal stayed in Q3. So, because of what you window while so short, so Q3 got topped up two ways from Q1, Q2 and in Q3. So now when you think of Q4 and you are now comparing it against a very top up Q3, Q3, and some of that top of in Q3 directly impacts Q4. So Q4 gets impacted by comparing against a strong Q3. But I think some those Q3 bookings that normally would stay in Q4 stay in Q3, to now book, if you like a double factor driving the comparison between Q3 and Q4. Also, we believe the booking window will start expanding Q4 so more than bookings in Q4 will actually leak out of Q4 than did in Q3 relatively. So, you've got these two factors kind of driving a very unusual comparison between Q3 and Q4. So, a fai r amount more sequential revenue decline. It's all timing and all mechanics. But think of it as a Q4 comparing a Q3 on steroids. And some of the reason why Q3 was in steroids will directly impact Q4 because that's what's going on."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gal Munda Hi,  for taking my questions. The first 1 is just I'd like to understand a little bit around the dynamics around the ARR guide for next year. If you can help us unpack. The guidance is a little bit wider than we have this year to 13%. What you're thinking behind, and what gets you to the higher end of the range versus the lower end of the range? Yeah. Everyone, please standby. One moment. Please standby the conference will resume momentarily. Once again, please standby on the conference will resume momentarily. We will return to music hold until the call cameras are on.  for your patience."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann . It will still be step-by-step? Yeah. However, it will start sooner and the phases will be dramatically compressed,  to $45 million in new spending, which is a lot of new spending."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Wong  for taking my questions and to make you feel better, supposedly HubSpot ran into some issues at the beginning as well. So not to this [Indiscernible]."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Matt Shimao . But no, it doesn't make us feel better."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Wong I feel like someone in the [Indiscernible] that people forgot to make their picks for the question is now falling on me, this is . So lots of moving pieces here. I just wanted to touch on -- as far as the Cloud transition as you guys are changing tires while the car is still in motion, should we think about the near-term guidance, the outlook as maybe being a little more conservative? And then as you look longer-term, you start to feel more confident because like you said, there are more, I guess there's more optionality. Is that the right way to think about how you're approaching the next few years? Or if I'm wrong there, please let me know if you guys have a different approach in terms of how we should be thinking about the numbers that you guys laid out."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kristian Talvitie Yeah. I mean, I think to a degree, right? For sure. I mean, setting aside and macro and the fact that we don't have a crystal ball there and everything like that. We're launching a major SaaS initiative, but don't have in our guide big assumptions it will hit this year. I think it will hit next year and hit even harder in the years that follow. But we haven't planned a lot into this year. Partly because, again, we need to get this earnings call out there, we need to launch everything, we need to start the sales cycles, and then we need to close the orders. And if you put 6 to 9 month sales cycles on things and we're not exactly  sure how long it will take, but 6 to 9 months lands you in Q3 or Q4 already. And so we're just not sure. Then when the start dates might be and all that type of stuff. So we're fairly conservative about the cloud impact to fiscal '22, but quite bullish about it to fiscal '23, '24, '25, and beyond. The other thing is as we've said, we're a little bit conservative, more so than in past years as it relates to Rockwell. It could be wrong there, but we're just saying, let's not get ahead of ourselves in case they get distracted with this integration Plex. I don't think Rockwell thinks they'll get distracted, but again, we're just trying not to get out over [Indiscernible]."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Broome And as far as all the sales motion that are going to change the 2 in the box, I guess have you had efficiently factored in potential disruption to this year as you guys worked through that or is it kind of these motions or just kind of typical PTC and you guys feel you can pivot on the fly here."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann Yeah well, what's happening on the sales side of the two in the box is pretty typical stuff that happens every year and which is to say not that extreme. A few more resources here and shifting a little bit what are overlays and not overlays, things like that. That's pretty typical. And I don't see any unusual degree of risk there whatsoever. What's happening on the other side is a little bit more dramatic, but frankly, most of that is what happens after the customer buys from us. And I actually think it's all good changes anyway. So I don't see that disrupting sales, I see it actually making customers happy because they stop getting passed around from one person to another and having to re-explain who they are and all that kind of stuff. So I don't know. I don't think it's a high-risk change. Certainly, I don't see it that way. And we're eager to go execute it."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann Okay Matt, sorry, we didn't get to you last time around. We're going to try to disconnect halfway through your questions."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Broome Nowhere to tell. My question was just about the $50 million in relative savings of FY21. You did mention saving money in your sales organization, but in what other areas that you're spending less to free that money out? And is that likely to affect any sort of revenue generating activities?"
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann Yeah, no. Again I want to be clear it's not in sales. It's really in customer success, where we used to have many organizations that took turns talking to customer. They all had management change. They all had overlapping responsibilities, etc. So the place we've taken the most money out of would be in customer success. The stuff that happens after the customer buys. And we're doing that not by just reducing capability, but by simply implementing a much more efficient model with many less silos, much less management involved, and so forth. So that's all, goodness. There are other places we'll have efficiencies. Let me give you an example. If you belong to a field organization working technical support, your mission is to make the customer happy even if it means solving the same problem dozens or hundreds of times quickly. If you're part of the product organization, your goal is to go back and talk to the product guys and tell them, make this product go away in the SaaS offering quickly, so that no other customers are even aware that it ever did exist. You can see those real efficiencies in terms of how you solve customer problems. Are you trying to make them happy while they have the problem? And repeat that hundreds of thousands of times or are you trying to make the problem go away so that the rest of the customers never knew it happened? Just to summarize. These are  efficiencies that we're going to go pursue."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Matthew Broome Now that makes a lot of sense. If I could also just ask just given the [Indiscernible] how the unfavorable change in relationships with the channel and does it change that rolling in anyway?
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann And then I think if you look at our resellers, it'll change their world a little bit, they still need to go sell the software. They won't be as evolved in delivering it, but then they are very much involved in the implementation of it at the customer side. So I don't want you to think as it relates to resellers or SIs that SaaS companies don't have SI partners. My God, Salesforce has a massive SI ecosystem. They just don't install software and perform upgrades at the customer site. They do system integration, they do adoption, and they do business process transformation. They do all that stuff which still has to happen. So that's kind of long term. I think SIs have to take the posture they have relative to Salesforce and all those other SaaS companies, which will help them through and the bigger ones like Accenture already know that play. And then for the smaller resellers, the other thing worth noting is tha t most of our resellers sell Creo and Kepler. And those products are further out on the SaaS road map anyway, so that will be several years down the road before we even really come to that bridge."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jason Celino Hi guys. T hanks for fitting me in. A little deja vu here with the transition, but maybe sell the subscription transition on the pricing change. With that transition will be a deployment change. When we think about the Cloud opportunity for PLM, when we think about the sources of possible acceleration, will it be more of a share gain type story or a pricing uplift from the lift and shift?"
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann Yes. I think it will be both, but let me first redefine pricing up lift so we don't confuse anybody. We will deliver more value to the customer and they will pay us more for that value while saving money on their side, above and beyond. So is that a pricing increase? I don't know. It's a value increase. And that could drive a tremendous amount of business. Creo and Windchill are a billion-dollars and you could double $750 million of that over a decade with that $750 million of more value delivered to the customer base and monetize. However, what we're seeing with Arena and to a degree with Windchill is we have the cloudiest sassiest solutions in the market and that does help take share. Every piece of business that Arena is winning. They're taken from somebody else or it's a start-up Company that they're winning on somebody else's expense. And Arena is a fastest growing P1 solution in the market right now. So I do think it's both, and you know exactly what the balance would be, I don't know. I do think monetizing the customer base by delivering more value is a high probability and it will drive a lot of growth by itself."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann Yeah well, let me hit the second question first. The new business unit is fundamentally formed to help us better execute on cross sells, because we do see that platform deal structure happening more and more. The example you gave with Global, I could repeat a dozen more examples of that, of customers who started with 1 product and pretty soon they have 2 and then 3 and they're trying off the fourth one and so forth. And we think that our products Creo, Windchill ThingWorx, Vuforia work beautifully together. Like voices in a choir, they make beautiful music together. And rather than selling these things separately, yes, we can use them all as entry points, but let's pursue entry points that then can be up-sold and cross-sold, And so, I think Troy Richardson was one of the first people to ask, why don't you guys configure differently -- us guys now that he's here, but why don't we configured differently and go pursue this harder, this cross-sell motion, so that's exactly what we're doing is that's a little bit how the name digital thread came to be."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tyler Radke Hey, . I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the TLM SaaS transition. It sounds like that's starting now, so assume that in some ways that products already obviously, it's probably going to get better over time. But how are you thinking about pricing as a lever to push customers towards that? Whether it'd be price increases on the on-time side or maybe initial discounts to get early customers over to the SaaS offering."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann Yes. Well, let me comment on the first part of your question and then the second part. So again, we've been on boarding customers' SaaS for a while with PLM. And think of it that they're coming in at one margin and what our goal is to make improvements behind the scenes that take them to another margin even at the same cost to the customer. So whether  it's single-tenant, multi-tenant, if you're the customer on the customer end, you don't even know. But we on the PTC end, we see the efficiencies we're gaining or not gaining, we do know. And so a lot of our investment is aimed at making the product more efficient for PTC to deliver, as opposed to different from the usage end at the customer side. Now that said, if you look what we did with the subscription program, we pulled every lever we could come up with. Do you remember that program when we used to talk about it, we used to say, and I don't know Kristian. Kristian actually was the program executive. We had 28 work-streams and 300 people working on it. We changed pricing and packaging to favor subscription over at the time perpetual. We paid more commission on a perpetual deal. We had certain offerings they were only -- I'm sorry we paid more commission I said that wrong on a subscription deal. We had certain offerings that were only available, attractive sexy offerings including the answer stuff by the way, there was only available subscripti on. So we basically stack the deck in every customer conversation in a way that everybody wanted it to go subscription. We got the band back together, we're putting the same program together, and we’ll stack the deck again in favor of SaaS this time."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Adam Borg  so much for taking the question. Just real quickly on IoT, I think you mentioned during the prepared remarks that it was slightly below our expectations in the quarter. So maybe to talk a little bit more about what led to that. And the confidence you have in that improving in fiscal '22, maybe even in the context of DPM.  so much."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann Yes. So first Adam, let's be clear. Exactly what I said. Bookings in the quarter were very strong. However, much of the bookings in a Q4 does not land in the ARR in the Q4, it's back to that start base discussion. What I said is that ARR was less than we wanted it to be. It was mid-teens and frankly, we've said we wanted to have a 2 handle. Now, bookings in every quarter of fiscal '21 were higher than the previous year quarter in fiscal '20. So there is some bookings momentum happening. And then another thing is we launched this DPM solution that frankly we've been working for 2 years. It's a major piece of software that we launched in, already has quite some customer interest. So we feel like the combination of the bookings momentum we have including and especially in Q4 and then the launch of DPM and the trends we're seeing. They bode well for what should happen next year."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Blair Abernethy Hey guys.  for taking the time. Just two quick things. First on the DPM, Jim, what's sort of the -- is there a shift in the go-to-market with this solution of R and are their more solutions coming this year, next year in behind us."
4465248,"PTC, Inc.",PTC,11/4/2021,CEO James Heppelmann on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"James Heppelmann Yeah, I think what she should I think first of all, is it DPM, will become a category of solutions. And what we're launching first is DPM for factory. Digital performance management of what happens in a factory. There will be solutions that are more focused on digital performance management of a fleet of products out in the field at customer sites. But fundamentally what we are trying to do is move from selling a toolkit where the customer does the solutioning themselves to selling a turnkey solution with a very strong value proposition, sold to executives not to developers, sold on the basis of the business value it will generate, and then implemented quickly in the production. So yeah, it's a very different sales motion. I mean, number one, we're selling to executives not selling to developers. Number 2, we're selling business value, not speeds and feeds, technical stuff. And I think it's really where we wanted to take this business for a while. So I'm very pleased with the solution. It took us a while to develop it, as I said, but it's a powerful piece of software and it really gives us a new platform to build on going forward with IoT. It makes IoT f I could, a lot like how we sell PLM. We sell PLM to executives based on business value. We were selling IoT to developers as a toolkit, and now we'll sell PLM and DPM as business value to executives. Different executives mind you but executives. . . Well, Operator maybe I'll just take it from here. First again my apologies. This is like the strangest earnings call I've had again, and it's the 44th one as CEO. So it's a bit odd, but nonetheless, I think we got a lot of good information out there and you guys had some s and I appreciate it. So in closing, I mean, we're in a  place. I really like PTC setup going forward. The changes we announced are good for growth, they're good for profitability. They're going to put us in a stronger position to hit both the top-line and bottom-line targets that we have out there. So we're look ing forward to continuing a discussion with you on follow-up calls at investor conferences. I'm going to be at the Berenberg Conference, at least virtually next week or I guess it's 2 weeks out maybe, it’s No, it's next week. And we look forward to seeing you at our investor meeting on December 15th. So , everybody, and have a . Ladies and gentlemen,  for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ann Duignan Yes. Hi. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about the outlook for 2022 and what you see across the different segments. I know you said in some of your opening comments that you do expect an infrastructure built path. If that doesn't happen would that influence your outlook for 2022 at all for buildings and also Geospatial? And then the [Indiscernible] in Agriculture which continue to see farmer sentiment decline on higher input costs, not just in the U.S, but also in Brazil. So maybe talk about some of the pluses and minuses that you're seeing out there as you look to 2022, and the end-markets. ."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Devin Au Hi, this is actually Devin on for Jason, potentially taking my questions. First one I have on construction. Just wondering if you could provide an update on I guess, e-Builder and viewpoint. I know that you guys re-branded, but any color on EAR growth and growth drivers there would be helpful."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Hi, . So the combined ARR growth between the 2 businesses was set up plus 17% year-over-year. So another  quarter of execution between the 2 businesses. As you noted with the rebranding, we are especially optimistic around the Trimble Construction One offering. We converted over a 1,000 customers to the Trimble Construction One offering. Sold dozens of new logos onto the offering in the quarter and that -- bookings that creates ARR later down the road but the value proposition and the awareness from the customers is quite encouraging. A nd we've seen that in the bookings for some time now and which now plays through the ARR expansion."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Devin Au , that's helpful. And just one more, and staying on construction and you are definitely encourage to see the connected construction. On platform, but just want to ask are you -- in terms of like market opportunity, are you still mainly displacing these legacy systems that they were based processes out there or are you seeing meaningfully more interest from contractors and owners looking for a more connected solution?"
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter There are both. It's a . From a market -- overall market perspective, really the secular opportunity and construction technology, by the way, I would see this in our other end markets as well. Is that these markets are large. They're global, they're underserved, and they are underpenetrated by a technology. So the move to digitization provides a value proposition t hat delivers productivity, quality, safety, efficiency, transparency, the environmental sustainability. So there's a positive catalyst for technology to be adopted. And at some level, yes, that is replacing paper-based systems. That exists or let’s says just the mental based systems that exist. And we are seeing demonstrable interest from customers in the connected solutions that we offer and I've had a chance to talk to a number of the customers personally, some that are shown us how they're already taking our technology and connecting the various solutions to improve their workflow. And one of the things they do is not only connect a Trimble workflow, but an Trimble environment that can provide actually accommodate environment. We can connect in an open and really agnostic way to the other technology that our customers use. Customers operated as you know, in the construction industry is fragmented. Therefore, the technology tends to be a bit fragmented as well. And so our ability in approach to connect Trimble and non-Trimble solutions is very top-of-mind for customers. And of course, COVID has also been a catalyst from a digitization perspective. So much of what we do, can uniquely connect the work in the office and the field that connects the hardware and the software and ultimately that physical and digital."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rob Wertheimer Hi, . And Rob,  for that answer. I actually would like to follow-up on a couple of points you were making there. Just on the future of digitalization [Indiscernible] construction, I wondered -- there's a very large opportunity. Do you feel like there is an acceleration? Is there a tipping point where we're visible in the next 2 or 3 years or X time frame where you have to be digital or you're not there? Just a general sense on how fast that market is moving. And then do you think it's coalescing around 2 or 3 sort of platforms, yourselves being one of them. And that's kind of the Construction one idea or is that too aggressive statement? And it's still a hodgepodge of a bunch of different assets, maybe just asking you to assess the competitive platform dynamic as well. ."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Hi Rob and . From a tipping point perspective and an acceleration perspective, I think the numbers would prove the acceleration of the adoption of technology. And if we were to get an infrastructure bill, which by the way, we're talking about that in a U.S. context. But we see a construction lead recovery really globally in many markets. And so HS2 is a really nice project in the U.K., [Indiscernible] and Paris. The rail project is expected to be a very large project, and there's large projects happening and Saudi and Australia continues to have some big development. We see the fundamentals in the macro's providing ability to accelerate it. I think, really, the move to have the digitization, COVID I really do feel has accelerated that perhaps hasn't inflected so many of our customers were unable to actually go out to the field like they used to go to do or they realize the need to be Cloud connected in Cloud -enabled when they weren't going to their offices at frequent, as frequently. And we think that's helped us drive more bookings in the business to the cloud offerings. And as it relates to a tipping point that's a really . That's a bit of a crystal ball. I think one of the catalysts that could create a tipping point, would be if we see more of this driven from owners. And I will say as well as regulators and maybe I really mean policy when I say that. So from an owner perspective, that's actually the premise of why we did the e-Builder acquisition because who fundamentally has the most at stake when a project's late or over budget, of course it's the owner and so we help them manage their capital programs. From a policy and regulatory perspective, where we have a point of view as we the [Indiscernible] take that U.S. infrastructure bill as an example. I mean this is a generational opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the united -- of the infrastructure in the U.S.. And we can deliver that infrastructure 20%, 30% cheaper through the use of technology. So it just makes sense. And so, if more of this, if we can increase the level of awareness, I'm certainly an [Indiscernible] that there's a policy measure here are certainly encouragement measure, and that's why I talked about that digital construction Management Act because it provides an incentive for DOTs to adopt technology. I'd say we're all staying tuned for that one. There is something that's sort of fundamentally creates an acceleration on that -- on the tipping point part of it. And then you asked about platforms, Rob. And on the platform side, I think it is logical to think that there would be some coalescing around a few platforms. I mean, as you said, the industry is rather fragmented. We're not the only technology platform out there actually. I think there needs to be interoperability between those technology platforms, and t hat very much shapes how we build our technology. It is an underlying fundamental belief that we have."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Ho Hi, . I wanted to maybe start out with some of the supply chain issues. Can you talk a little bit about maybe what the increases in lead times look like for your customers and have you seen any potential losses given the extended backlog and potentially delivery times?"
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Barnes< /strong> Hey, Jonathan, it's David. The lead times vary a lot by product, but historically, our lead times have been very short measured in a few days. And there are many times that, so weeks and in some cases, many weeks or a few months, and that's the math of the backlog that you're seeing. As far as the competitive dynamics, in a very few isolated cases, we can identify where we've lost business to a competitor that can supply more quickly. Typically they are competing at the lower end of the market and in some cases those customers have come back. But I think the generally our competitors are experiencing at least similar pressure to where we have and we don't believe that this has had an adverse impact on our share trends. In fact, in our hardware businesses where we can see numbers that are published by our peers or competitors. There is evidence in many of those segments that we're gaining share. We also haven't seen a meaningful amount of orders being canceled because the lead times are extended. So it's something we're watchful for. We're lucky as Rob said in his comments, have a really capable of. Operations team that has done a remarkable job getting supply in this very difficult environment."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Ho Excellent. And then just as a follow-up, just given the strength in your Ag business, I'm wondering, are you seeing a change in the types of products that you're selling into that market, especially relative to historically when it was sort of focused on guidance systems? Are you seeing sort of that broader digital transformation happening in this segment as well? ."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Hey Jonathan. It's Rob, I'll take that one. I'd say the product mix is relatively stable at the moment. What I would say, we're doing a better job of is connecting the software and the hardware and the correction services into the offerings that we have some more of that bundling at a point-of-sale and making ourselves easier to do business with. We have picked up some new OEM customers along the way, and then we've seen some strength in -- particular strength in various geographies. So in the quarter Brazil was very strong for us. Russia was also very strong for us. So there's, I'd say there's pockets, geographic pockets, where we're able to increase the penetration. In terms of a discernible shift in the overall mix of the portfolio. Not really at this point."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jerry Revich Hi, , and . I was wondering, Rob, if would you mind expanding on the recurring bookings growth you folks outlined in your prepared remarks and transportation, I think it's the most positive tone you've [Indiscernible] transportation in a while. Can you just unpack that? What part of the business is driving the recurring growth and what do the churn rates look like on the legacy business where we're working through the headwinds. ."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Sure. Hi, Jerry . Within the transportation business, historically talked about 3 legs on the stool though the technology stack. The first being that we provide mapping, routing, navigation engines. Second, that we provide the back office technology for trucking companies. And third, that we provide the field mobility tools for companies. In terms of the booking and then those are the 3 historic legs of that stool. And then over the last couple of years, we've moved as well to address the shipper side of the market whereas historically this strength is on the carrier side. On the carrier side of the business, where we see the bookings, growth is in a couple of places. So first in that [Indiscernible] ERP systems, we called it a Transportation Management System and we're moving that business to a recurring model. So there's a model conversion that's happening in there. And we have seen evidence that we're increasing the size of the addressable market, which means we're reaching some customers that we hadn't previously reached. And that's translating into 20% plus bookings growth on a year over year basis in that part of the business. What we're seeing as well on the mobility side, which is really more of the EOD part of the business. As we have seen, some life there, both through two things. 1,... increasing penetration and existing customers as some of our existing customers, actually many of them are adding capacity given the market. In fact, they would like to add more capacity in many cases aren't able to actually get the vehicles are the drivers to do it, but that's one area where we see growth. And the others as we do see some logos are coming back to us, which has been a really good sign for us. Still a long way to go, but I'm liking what I'm seeing from the team, and the pace of the team, and the trajectory and that Canadian ELD certification was a nice proof point that we're not just talking about these things, that we are actually also are delivering. That mapping, routing, navigation business has had many, many years of double-digit recurring revenue growth, which means bookings continue to grow strong and they continue to do a  job in quarter-in and in quarter-out. [Indiscernible] up and that got to the commentary on the script. You asked Jerry about the churn rate as well."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Yeah. On the churn rate side, I'd characterize it in net retention, and net retention was above 100% in the quarter, which is obviously a  sign for us."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jerry Revich It's really nice to hear about the inflection there and you know in buildings and infrastructure, I know you have really good visibility on the prospective pipeline and bookings. Can you talk about if you've seen a n acceleration in those lead indicators that you track for e-Builder and viewpoint, given the labor shortages, etc. Could we actually see ARR accelerate further from the strong rate that we're running at in 3Q."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter So, yes, actually we do think we can accelerate the level of our growth actually across the Company. And then that being the biggest contributor really to that growth, it absolutely -- it's something that we have a line of -- reasonable line of sight to after the current bookings growth as we plan the business forward, we'll think about in any given quarter or a year for that matter, what's quote-on-quote in the bank and then what's the go-get when we think about that go-get than you can measure the pipeline you have and then you measure the qualified leads you have against that. So you kind of just keep working backwards from that equation and then do you have the horsepower to go and possible effect the pipeline and to turn it into a booking which eventually turns into the revenue. In addition, Jerry another catalyst to rest coming into next year is, our structures business. So that will [Indiscernible] business, the steel concrete business, so that in the summer, we stopped selling perpetual licenses. And so -- in fact, we sold more perpetual this year than we had anticipated and now that we're off the -- almost entirely off the perpetual, that just by the math will provide a catalyst for ARR our [Indiscernible] bookings, which will turn into ARR so that alone would be a catalyst to our ARR growth in that business looking into next year."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Weston Twigg Hi,  for taking my questions. Actually I have 2, if you'll allow it. First, just the Geospatial segment has been growing really strongly. And I'm just wondering if you could help us just get a fuel for those trends through next year, how sustainable is this rate of growth?"
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Hi, this is Rob. . Big kudos to the Geospatial team. The latest innovation that went to market in the third quarter was the MX50 Mobile Mapping System. And that's on the heels just really many innovations over the last few quarters between the X7 Laser Scanner our [Indiscernible] receiver a really nice run for this. The business has I'd say a pretty good amount of backlog associated with it. As we look forward into 2022, we think that we do have the [Indiscernible] at our backs and that we can continue to grow the business. Now the stunning growth that we've had in that business in 2022 or 2021, excuse me. No, I don't see that that wouldn't progress as we've said a few years ago, we -- that this was we think thought of it as our most mature of the businesses that we have and it has proved to more than once lately to be the -- one of the fastest growers within Trimble on a year-over-year basis, so really a lot of excellent innovation. And as well, our go-to-market team has just done an outstanding job with the channel management around the world. And I would expect that to temper back somewhere closer into the Company average of the 6 to 9 organic range as we go into next year. I would take that as a starting point."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Weston Twigg That's very helpful. . And then the other question I had, you mentioned the cop 26 conference, the discussions around there, and with all the severe weather events this year and how this impacted your customers, I'm wondering if you could maybe discuss some of your broader revenue opportunities with respect to climate change adaptation. Specifically, thinking about some of your agricultural construction infrastructure customers. And maybe outweighing broadly speaking, how that revenue opportunity could ramp."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Oh,  for that question. So I'm excited and I'm actually quite inspired by the ability Trimble to play a fundamentally positive impact, or a fundamentally positive role in impacting climate change. Now, the truth of the matter is that our products and our technology have had a positive environmental, sustainability benefit for as long as we have been around. I mean, it's been a byproduct of the productivity and efficiency that our customers generate. What I see as an opportunity is that comes more and more to the forefront. In some cases, it's just our customers have more reporting to do themselves. Whether they realize it now, some of them do and or rather they don't, we see that coming and then we see an ability to go to move into that space. If you take Agriculture as an example, we do have a small business in Ag that essentially runs a carbon marketplace. We get calls from customers or potential customers asking for help in certifying the offsets t hat they're buying. Think about our -- we tend to talk about our Agriculture business, but we also have a nice forestry business. These are two places that are hugely important in this conversation. And so as big companies are making their own commitments and buying offsets, they don't want to buy bad offsets. And so we're encouraged by the types of calls that we're getting because it's giving us conviction of where we take our product road map to positively impact us. I mean, if I think about the construction space, our structures business, so the steel part of the structures business. We did an announcement a couple of weeks ago of something that I think is pretty compelling as we can continue from a design perspective, essentially to design for sustainability, to understand the carbon load that a building has during that design and engineering phase. For many years, we've had a pre -design product to help you understand, let's say the energy consumption profile of a building. And as the users of the buildings on let's say, if there becomes regulatory pressure on this, to design with carbon in mind, the constructible models that we  provide at Trimble have a profoundly positive ability to impact designing and maintaining and operating with sustainability in mind. So we're actually putting some -- our resources to this. Because I see, all of us at Trimble see or board sees some really interesting opportunities that at some point will turn into commercial opportunities. Now that they turn into commercial opportunities is something discrete and separate, or are they part of the existing technologies we have? I would see there I don't know. But you follow what's going on and you've got -- I've got to believe that there's some material business for us to have here."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Weston Twigg That's really helpful and  for all the effort in that category for sure. .
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chad Dillard I actually want to go back to Trimble Construction 1, I was hoping you can give a little bit more context on where it belongs in the prior portfolio. My first question is just on just how much overlap does it a have versus your current product offering and then maybe you could talk about at least like your initial sales, whether you're seeing more come from conversions versus new customers. And then secondly, it to extend to this new platform expand the opportunity to [Indiscernible]."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Chad, so this is Rob, I'll take the question. So where to start? Our Trimble Construction 1 offering, essentially right now can take what we do at viewpoint. I mean, at viewpoint, years ago, we moved from selling, I'll call it an ERP on an office - based solution to moving to selling a combined team and Field Solutions, so think, project management and field mobility tools. And we called it viewpoint one and then we caught an [Indiscernible] office team field offerings. So it moved from a point solution to a bundled viewpoints solution and now that next step is and to Trimble Construction 1, what the first release of it. That brings in many aspects of our MEP business. So it's mechanical, electrical, plumbing business and we're able to bring in detail or an estimator workflows into the product offering. And then from there, we have a basis where we can continue to expand across other architectural and engineering workflows and products that we have. So by and large, it's taking what we do already and having a better packaging around that. Making it easier for our customers to consume the technology. From a technology perspective, it's better integration, tighter integration between the solutions that we have. Our customers have been asking for this, and so we're really excited to be able to start delivering upon it. I would say it's just the start. It's Version 1 of Trimble Construction 1. There are many other capabilities that we believe we can bring into that both from a civil perspective as well as a vertical construction perspective. And the natures of the conversions we have thus far are predominantly with the existing customers and moving them over. But we did get a few dozen new logos during the quarter on Trimble Construction 1. It's very much a persona based growth platform. We think about personas and in architectural engineering work persona, we think about a contractor persona. We think about an owner persona. And then we'll as we migrate over time will get -- be able to get more and more. I'll say specific and targeted to delivering Construction, Trimble Construction 1, to those individual persona. So I'd really say the start of much more to come and the more that we connect the data, the users, and the workflow across this data be gets the opportunity to move into richer data, AI opportunities. And there it gets then another level of exciting so the more we can connect what we've got for our customers, the more of that will create solutions down the road."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chad Dillard ,  for that. Second question, more so on your hardware business, just trying to understand the progression of price cost and maybe you can just walk us through what the price cost balance. It was 1Q, 2Q, 3Q. I think you said for 4Q, it's negative and then I guess most importantly, where do we go from here for this year? If I remember correctly, there's a portion of your business that is under [Indiscernible] longer-term contracts and when do those anniversary up get up for a renegotiation."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Barnes Hey, Chad, let me give you some  perspective and all sort of ground. My comments in what we mentioned last time, when this very uncertain world we were estimating that for the full year 2021, we'd have inflation in aggregate of about 6% of our $600 million in COGS, so that's $36 million. We're definitely running north of that. We're probably about $10 million more in product and freight inflation than we were anticipating. And we've adopted our pricing strategy all year in response to our best guess of where things are. You're right there's some latency in -- when you can make a decision and implement the strategy, and it really differs by business and customer. In some cases, we can implement a price increase by smarter and less discounting. Some cases there's a surcharge that's possible, some cases, you have to wait for a list price. But I would say our pricing momentum has kept up with the inflation outlook that we started with. But we're running behind because inflations [Indiscernible] than we believe. So your understanding is correct. We're behind inflation now. Even though the pretty much the full impact of our price increase came through in Q4 will be modes tly negative, not hugely modestly negative. Going forward it's a very tough world to guess cost inflation. And we think it's not going to get better soon. We're optimistic it won't get a lot worse. We have some more work to do on the pricing front, but I would say in aggregate, it is still our view that over time we can offset the inflation costs impact with pricing. It's just going to take us into next year to do that."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kristen Owen Hi. . This is Christian on for call,  for taking the question. Just. And to follow up on some of the commentary around the connection Scale and sort of the acceleration of that spend into 2022, just wondering if you can provide an update on sort of the internal processes that you're going through where you stand in those and any metrics around identifying what that opportunity set is based on the multi-product customers."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Well, hey, Kristen, this is Rob from let's say, to put context around where we're spending the money, digital -- around digital transformation, and we believe through that digital transformation that that will in turn lead to inability to scale our revenue growth, particularly the recurring revenue growth and the growth of bundled offerings. We do believe there'll be an Infrastructure Bill that comes and even if it doesn't come, we believe there is a fundamental ability for us to play a positive impact within infrastructure to have it is built better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener. So we've been -- we have been putting more resources to that which we in turn think will help us grow the business. And we take up both the short-term and long-term view when we come to extent the questions around how we actually come to that answer. And we believe it's the right thing to do for the business. But I think it'll only have answered half your questions, so sorry. Tell me what else we can help with. [Indiscernible]"
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kristen Owen The internal processes, where you are in that process of identifying where you can create synergies internally, how you're going to market more efficiently. Just sort of connecting the internal data backbone. An update there would be really helpful."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter From an internal perspective there, actually, I like the progress we've made through our annual strategy exercise as we do each of our major franchises. I'm have defined there what Connect and scale means to them. And our industry. Cloud strategies are Platform strategies that relationship with Microsoft. And we think is a really big deal for us and where we take the business going forward. We've got demonstrable success on digital transformation efforts with some of the underlying plumbing that we're putting in place. So things, like, common identity, licensing, entitlement engines, which really are just the call of the must-haves table stakes for where we're going as an organization. Most of our businesses of identified where they see cross-sell, up-sell opportunity within the customer -- within, I'll say common customer personas. So I like the work that we're doing and in preparation, I wish it could come faster. How about these things do have a bit of a natural course they take."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kristen Owen And then if I could, the follow-up to a previous question related to the hardware sales versus our growth. Just wondering, given the strength that you've seen in hardware over the last, call it year or so. How we should think about that as a precursor for ARR growth.  very much."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Erik Lapinski Hi team, this is Erik [Indiscernible].  for squeezing us in. Maybe, just a follow-up on that last question, when we think about some of the incremental investment you're planning over the next year. I was going through this process of connecting more of the assets that whether they were acquired over time or kind of built separately at all, impacted your appetite for M&A? Just wondering if that is a factor."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter No, I'd say it hasn't impacted it all. We will look at acquisitions where we think it can accelerate this strategy, and have a positive impact on Connect & Scale and building out our industry platforms. We also think more of these days is about partnership, and I think Microsoft is a good example of that there's multiple paths to get to this strategy."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Erik Lapinski . I mean, ma ybe if I could squeeze in one more. You talked about the high-teens growth in viewpoint e-Builder, but when we look at overall subscription growth, somewhat flattening organically. Can you help us understand what areas of subscription grew somewhat slower? Is that mostly related to the transportation segment or there are any other factors?"
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Magi Hi, guys. This is Ed Magi on for Gal Munda. My question relates to the Microsoft partnership with Construction 1, how much of this is technology partnership versus go-to-market efforts? And what do you estimate the timing for GA for this I'd love to hear some examples of new products that could follow after. ."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rob Painter Hi, this is Rob. I'll take the question and . So technology and go-to-market from and from a GA perspective on the on both of those intersecting -- I think next year, mid-to-late, next year would be about the time to think about GA. And then before then from a technology perspective, we get, I'll say incentives and help to move technology that we have. So it helped us accelerate the velocity and the development efforts. So we get some help on the technology side, there. Our nature of relationship does give us a better pricing on the Cloud cycles that we consume. And then yes, the idea is to build the Construction Cloud powered by Azure. And in doing so, we believe there are some unique and novel things that we can bring to that construction Cloud and just think about the breadth and depth of what we do at Trimble. And now mapped out at a go-to-market perspective, you've got tens of thousands of sellers between Microsoft and Partner network on top of the sellers that we have on a global scale and quickly get a sense of why I am very excited about the opportunities to help us with reach and scale. as a result of this relationship. And we do think that there's some really interesting technologies to combine between the two companies and stay tuned for more on that in time."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Edward Magi [Indiscernible] the question and congrats to the quarter.
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rob Mason Yes. . . I'll try to be real quick here. I just wanted to clarification first the commentary around Connect and Scale investments for this year. Could you confirm, did you say that you thought you would be back on model with respect to incremental margins in 2023 or did I hear that correctly."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Barnes Hey, Rob, It's David. So I think I'd characterize our comments is sort of broad outlook to 2022, little early to talk about 2023, But just add a little more color. We are in an investment mode in the areas that Rob talked about in digital transformation, in autonomy, and in our major accounts. Go to market activities, which are all really critical to take advantage of the strategic opportunity we have. And those are likely to result in OpEx, growth next year ahead of revenue growth. So I think we'll have, if you look back to the 2018 Investor Conference and the objective stated was operating leverage in the 25% to 30% range. I think we'll be in that range, but in 2022 at the lower end. And then I think it's logical to expect that we will have some of the positive benefit of that beginning in 2023. But I'll be cautious about making it firm prediction now."
4465294,Trimble Inc.,TRMB,11/4/2021,CEO Rob Painter Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rob Mason Sure, sure. Maybe the follow-on that is, if there was some news in the quarter around where you do have some autonomy exposure. Customer, they're planning to ramp some of the technology they leveraged from you. And how should we think about when that does happen, if it happens when -- is that more step function or is that more linear with, I guess the volumes around that?"
4465400,Iron Mountain Incorporated,IRM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Meaney on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sheila McGrath I guess god morning. Bill and Barry. I've gotten questions from investors. that bottom line, growth, and margin improvement has benefited from Project Summit. And that benefit will be less of a factor going forward. Can you outline what revenue growth opportunities you are positive about for Iron Mountain looking out the next few years? And a related question to that is, can you also outline how you're able to effectively present such a broad offering of products to your customers when it appears there be different context at the -- at the customers for storage versus data centers versus insight."
4465400,Iron Mountain Incorporated,IRM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Meaney on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"George Tong Hi, . .

4465400,Iron Mountain Incorporated,IRM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Meaney on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shlomo Rosenbaum Sorry. I was muted. . I wanted to ask a little bit about the storage business and some of the puts and takes that went through it. It seems like there is some other -- with an acquisition something added about 10 million cubic feet. You guys are getting pricing. There's some organic growth. But when I go to the total revenue from adjusted storage when including the terminations and permanent withdrawal fees, it's really flattish sequentially. And so I was just want to ask you, what are some of the puts and takes that you might have seen on a sequential basis because I think you commented last quarter expecting some volumes to come in that will pent up from COVID-19. And was just wondering how this is translating into revenue as you build through the year."
4465400,Iron Mountain Incorporated,IRM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Meaney on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Eric Luebchow . . I wanted to touch upon fairly topical area in data centers today. A lot of talk in the industry about cost inflation in terms of development costs along with supply chain challenges and getting new equipment. Maybe you could just give us your perspective on what you're seeing in your footprint. Whether that's -- any development cost, inflation, any development delays in terms of timing. And also the impact of higher power cost, particularly in Europe. And then from a broader pricing perspective, do you think that this environment may be supportive of industry pricing moving upwards in the next couple of years as we work through all these challenges? ."
4465400,Iron Mountain Incorporated,IRM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Meaney on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andrew Steinerman Hi, this is Alex on for Andrew Steinerman. Our question is regarding your guidance. Your guidance for high-single-digit percentage growth in revenue and low double-digit to low teens percentage growth in EBITDA for fourth quarter appears to imply an adjusted EBIDTA margin of about 36.5%. Can you confirm that we're doing the math there right? Maybe speak to some of the drivers behind that? ."
4465400,Iron Mountain Incorporated,IRM,11/4/2021,CEO Bill Meaney on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Barry Hytinen Hi, Alex. It's Barry. . Why don't I help you with both the revenue and the EBITDA the way we are thinking about it. So in the fourth quarter, you right, we said about high single-digit. So let's say that's 8% or 9% on the revenue side just to give you a couple of the puts and takes. We have a -- the dollar is stronger as we have less than a point of FX benefit year-on-year, and a similar amount from M&A less than a point because just as a reminder, as I mentioned to Shlomo, we divested that software Escrow business in the second quarter. And so as a result, it's not much M&A benefit. So that leaves you with about call it 7% of organic constant currency growth. And with the strength of the Data Center business, that'll contribute probably 1.5 points alone because that business is performing very well and so you should be working with your model and think like 20 plus percent growth in the fourth quarter from our Data Center business. The balance would be coming from low-single-digit growth in our storage rental revenue. And that'll be with good pricing contribution. Course the remainder is as Bill 's highlighted on the call, the very nice growth we're seeing out of our Digital Solutions and SITAD  business. On the EBITDA stand side, we're looking at low double-digit to low -- sorry, mid-teens growth. So let's say that's 13 or so percent just to keep the midpoint there. For the purpose of this discussion, that's about, call it, $48 million of year-on-year increase. FX is a very small contribution, almost nothing, and M&A would be actually a net negative on a year-over-year basis in light of the escrow business was a very high-margin. And so think about data center as having a modest increase in margin sequentially still affected by the fit-out in Frankfurt. So a few million of benefit to EBITDA from data center. Our Summit is -- our Summit Project is doing phenomenally well and the team is executing very well. You'll probably see $30+ million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter from that. And then of course, pricing will continue to be a very strong contributor. And the services margin, I expect to continue to improve which you've been seeing throughout the year. So naturally, there are some offsets with sale leaseback, as I mentioned earlier, and higher levels of commission in light of the very good trajectory the team is driving on top line. So we're feeling very good about the fourth quarter as we sit here today, and look forward to talking to you about it in 90 days. . Have a  day. , sir. This concludes our question and answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell Hopefully I contribute to the short earnings call, but just -- I think of the Company maybe over the last year, it was maybe more of a transition story. And we got, I guess, 3 increases in guidance throughout the year, including today. How do we think about going forward if we're more now on steady-state and the guidance you gave is probably more set and we look to be in the middle of it or do we continue to get maybe increases in guidance? And I have one follow-up."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Lesar Well, look, I hope you got a sense today of how confident we are in the business or the direction that the business is going at this point in time. And I think that we're starting to hit on cylinders. So, I agree, we we're in a transition. But I think going to transition to, what we believe ought to be, a premium utility. So, I think if you listened to what we said today and let me boil it down into pretty simple terms, whatever we do this year, we will do 8% more than next year. Whatever we do next year, we'll do 8% more of the year after that, and etc., as we outlined during our Analyst Day. But we've got a lot of tailwinds behind us right now, and we really, really like where we are."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell . And just one follow-up. David, the Analyst Day you gave us some  insight into, I guess just commodity prices maybe from a previous job you held. Just thoughts on -- are you seeing any type of change in your view that you think maybe the commodity and prices will end up coming down?"
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Lesar No, I think -- I assume you're referring to natural gas prices."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Wells Sure Dave. , Anthony. As we outlined at Analyst Day, we continue to work within our defined gas procurement plans for each jurisdiction. And as of today, looking across all of our Jurisdiction, we're roughly 60% hedged. Now that we're going into the upcoming winter season and for almost all of those jurisdictions, we've locked in kind of a weighted average cost of gas of somewhere between sort of the mid-3s and high 3s, $3 per MBTU in the majority of our jurisdictions. And so, feel well-positioned for this upcoming winter season. Obviously, we continue to look at what we can do across the business to ease the burden on our customers. And I think one example of what is the creative alternative rate stabilization plan that we just recently filed in Minnesota. So, we'll continue to look for ways to minimize. the bill impacts. But I feel like we're well prepared coming into this upcoming winter season."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell .  for taking my question. I will see you guys at EEI and, Dave, sorry about the Stros."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza Just with the current CapEx plan, you're obviously more levered to electric side of the business and the IRP in Indiana presents some additional upside beyond the 5 years for electric investment. Dave, do you have a target mix for electric versus gas contribution? What's the timeline to achieve it especially a s we're thinking about potentially further gas optimization funding, which seems to be a very sizable electric de - carbonization plan."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Lesar Yeah, I think that if you set a step back and take a look at 50,000 -- the sort of 50,000-foot level, the stand and direction and strategy the Company is to bias us toward the electric side of our business. Part of it is that coal transition certainly helps that because of the capital that it is going to absorb. And as we've said at ou r Analyst Day, and we've said in some of our prior calls, we don't need equity to execute this 10-year plan, but if other opportunities did come up, we know the inherent value of the remaining gas LDC s, And I could look to them as a source of liquidity. But I think bottom line is we're biased toward electric, and that is the way we will continue to drift. I'm not going to put a prediction out there as to what that ratio will be over time. But directionally, that's where we're headed."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza Got it. And then just lastly, obviously, a little bit behind on the CapEx as you highlighted in the prepared remarks, but still targeting that $18 billion plus. What are some of the governing factors to increasing the upside or bringing that a $1 billion into the base plan that we discussed during the Analyst Day?"
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Lesar I think it's a couple of things. One is just getting sort of final resolution and clarity around the new tools in the tool box with respect to the Texas legislative process. We highlighted today the temporary generation, for instance, that we've moved very, very quickly on those kinds of things, would absorb some of that additional billion-dollar in sort of contingent capital that we laid out on our Analyst Day. And the other just -- the other issue is going to be just findings sufficient crews and labor and parts and inventory and those kinds of things out there to accelerate it. So, I think the message we tried to leave at Analyst Day is we have $18 billion plus to spend in the next 5 years, $40 billion plus to spend in the next 10 years. And we will spend that capital as fast as we can reasonably do so as long as it's consistent with rate pressures that we will have, and to spend it efficiently. So again, we've got the wind at our back on many, many things and our capital spend opportunities is certainly one of those."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza . , and  for that. We'll see you guys soon. Appreciate it."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Insoo Kim  Dave. Just first question going back to Shar's question on the CapEx and a potential -- or I guess a delayed currently. I understand the reasoning for the year-to-date delay and how you're going to make that up, just when you look out currently at the current environment does structurally, are you seeing any concerns or challenges to get the current CapEx plan executed over the next couple of years, whether it is the labor shortages or just from a maybe from a cost standpoint, labor costs or other items that could potentially be a headwind?"
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Lesar Look, just like pretty much every other Company and management team in the U.S., we're dealing with supply chain issues, upward pressure on labor costs. But I don't think that we have seen that to such an extent that we are going to say that we can't meet the capital plan. We have every intention and we have every confidence we're going to meet the capital plan. We tried to give a little color to it with respect to that on the call today. We have moved aggressively to tie up more construction crews. We have expanded our vendor base in and around that area. One of the tools that we got in the new legislative processes, the ability to put long lead time items into inventory and into rate base. So, we're looking at all of those. I think the sort of small slip and capital spend this year really was unrelated to any of that. It really was related to the storms that really pounded into Louisiana. And as all utilities do, we help each other when those situations arise. And we released a number of our crews that we're focused on capital build for us to help the people in Louisiana get back on their feet. Those crews are now coming back. And as Jason said, we've got a short-term plan in place to catch up on that capital spend. But our longer-term view of tying up crews and making sure we have the long lead time items ordered give us a  deal of confidence that the capital plan we have is and it's going to be achievable."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Insoo Kim Understood. And just quickly, this -- the other question I had was, as we think about the closing of the midstream transaction, remind me, is there -- I know you've already priced up contingent sale of a portion of it, but is there a limit on how much you can sell in terms of the units at any given time?"
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Wells Insoo, . No, there is no direct limit. And we had talked about previously the need to register those units. Energy Transfer has already undertaken that effort, so we are free to execute contingent for -- up until the close as we have done, once the deal is closed, to the extent that we want to execute a marketed offering, we have to obviously coordinate with Energy Transfer. We have full fl exibility to do that after the close of the transaction. And then similarly, we will have the ability to dribble the share. So, I think we're moving to a place, a full control, no limitation on the number of units."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith ey,  team. Sorry about the Stros there. I wanted to send my condolences as well here."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,David Lesar I'd tell you I didn't think this turn into burial of the Astros. But I appreciate the sentiments. There's always next year remember that.
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith We know they're close to your heart. There we go. Indeed. Listen, just wondering what's driving the confidence still on the timeline for the ET deal here. I know you mentioned it here again, you mentioned at the Analyst Day, but maybe remind us where that process stands specifically with respect to FTC today, they continue to put out their own headlines?"
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Wells And , [Indiscernible]. It's Jason here. Look, as we've said at Analyst Day Energy Transfer Enable obviously taking the lead with this in the conversations with the FTC. We're clearly a very interested party and everything that we've observed just gives us confidence that this deal will get close here in the fourth quarter. So, I don't think -- it's probably more of a direct question for Energy Transfer, for how those conversations are going by the day. But as I said, as we observe the progress, we continue to remain confident of a close here in Q4."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. All right, fair enough. And then on this alternate stabilization plan. Can you talk a little bit more about the mechanics? Obviously, it's early here, but is there been any feedback so far, the proposal? Obviously, these are somewhat sensitive subject, so I'll let you respond accordingly."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Lesar , Julien. It's a really unique situation, obviously in Minnesota with the incremental gas costs from [Indiscernible] the fact that we've got a regular rate case scheduled there. And so, while we filed a typical rate case, we thought it was prudent to bring for what we've deemed the  stabilization plan. And I think we -- what it tries to do is build off of what was just a recent settlement of the last rate case filed in Minnesota. So, keeping similar terms on depreciation rates, cost of capital allows us to recover the capital that we will be spending over the next couple of years to improve the safety of our gas systems. It differs a little bit of the amortization of some regulatory assets for things like COVID-related costs and some of the incremental O&M that we had anticipated. But we think it puts us in a really good position to continue to improve system safety with our capital investment plans, while recognizing the rate impact and trying to moderate that for our customers there in Minnesota. And so early days in terms of conversations with stakeholders, but we hope that it is seeing as constructive solution in the backdrop of what is a unique situation there."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. And last one, just super quick there. I heard you guys comment on the backup gen in Texas. But any updates on differences, Texas [Indiscernible], obviously the [Indiscernible] will be moving fairly swiftly still here. Curious if there's anything to be said on that front as a function of reforms."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Lesar I think maybe just to tease you a little bit. Yes, we're having some dialogue with them on additional transmission lines, but it's really too early to talk about any specifics on it."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Julien Dumoulin-Smith Okay. fair enough. I suspect it as much. Bye. Best of luck. Speak soon.
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Hey. Hey, . Just one for me. Just on the Indiana solar program, David, near commentary, you mentioned 75/25 mix, 75 rate base, 25 PPA 'd. Is that sort of what you're targeting going forward in your plans? And just curious as to how you got there in terms of the 75/25 mix."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Wells , Durgesh. It's -- overall, as we look at this first sort of part of our coal transition plan, we're targeting a 50/50 allocation, that is 50% owned renewables, 50% contracted through PPAs for the renewable portion for the first tranche of the coal transition, We had filed originally, as you pointed out and as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, an initial tranche of solar that was 75% owne d, 25% PPA. We then subsequently filed in the third quarter this year for a 100% PPA solar projects. And so again, as you look through each of these individual filings, we're targeting a 50-50 owned contract target mix for renewables."
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd Just had one kind of a broad question just on draft federal legislation. And as you look at that, I know that's subject to change and who knows what the final version will look like. But I was thinking in particular about, I guess two elements: 1. I’ll be a tax policy and impacts in terms of cash flow, customer bills, etc. And then the other was just broad support for clean energy, whether that might change or enhance some of your resource plans and movement towards clean energy or accelerate some of your plans. So just curious what you're thinking there?"
4465402,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.",CNP,11/4/2021,CEO David Lesar on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Wells Yes, sure. , Steven. From a tax standpoint, we are a federal cash tax payer. Right now, as you cut through our financials, there's a lot of one-time items as we've executed on this transition to a pure play regulated utility and we will continue to see that. As you cut through that for us, we are our effective tax rate from a cash tax standpoint. It's somewhere between 8% to 10%. So clearly a minimum tax of 15% would put a little bit of impact or headwind on the financing plan. We don't think it's certainly something that we can overcome. We don't think it's an impediment to the CapEx plan that we outlined and still feel like we can continue to maintain a strong Balance Sheet as we outline and deliver on our $40-billion capital investment plan. So early days, we'll follow it, probably not as big an impact to us, as maybe some of our peers, just given the fact that we have been a federal cash taxpayer. But obviously, something we will continue to monitor."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeanine Way . Our first question, maybe for Dane. Can you walk us through the mechanics of how you're determining the buyback tranches? It looks like it could be on a concurrent quarterly basis, but we just wanted to get some more detail on that. And how did you decide on the 50% level of returns for 4Q 21 other than it needs a criteria of more than 40%? And I guess, what would make you change that number quarter-to-quarter?"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dane Whitehead s. I think there's a couple of different aspects to it. One is a little more tactical about how we execute the share repurchases. So briefly on that, we execute under short, 30 to 60 day -- can be 5-1 programs, so we can set those in motion and execute them over a short period of time. And that -- because of that short duration, it allows us to really calibrate return percentages more on a real-time basis based on what we're seeing in the business, whether it's capital spend levels, commodity prices, other aspects of what's going on. It also gives you the advantage in the can be 5-1 of riding through blackout periods. We view that stepping back a little more context for the decision process about when do you exceed the minimum -- our decisions are always grounded in our financial priorities which we talk about on a regular basis; generate corporate returns, significant sustainable free cash flow, bullet proof Balance Sheet, and then return significant capital to shareholders. We just talked about what we've done year-to-date, generated significant operating and free cash flow. Q4 looks like by far the best quarter yet from a financial perspective. The Balance Sheet is really strong and we retired $900 million debt in September a billion for year-to-date. So we're at $4 billion gross debt target ahead of schedule, and that only opens the door for much more substantial returns to equity holders if the conditions warrant. We also bumped the base dividend for the third time this year. It's up 100% over that period. And fuel's competitively positioned right now and also very sustainable through recycles at the current level. So we turned to the capital return framework that calls for returning a minimum of 40% of operating cash flow to shareholders when WTI is above $60. We look at Q4, not only is WTI well above $60, all the commodity complex is high. Oil volumes should be quite a bit stronger than they were in Q3. We expect an uptick in dividend distributions from EG and lower capex versus Q3, which was the high point of our burn rate for the year on the capital side. So we expect that lots of flexibility to exceed 40%. We also have a desire to continue to add some level of cash to the Balance Sheet. As we go through the year ultimately our plans are to pay off debt -- future debt maturities as they mature. And they aren't significant in the future, but we'd sized have that level of flexibility, and in the process reduce our net debt. So all of this, I think it's a  example of our shareholder return framework and action. It's -- it's based on a minimum percentage of operating cash follow, but we have the ability and latitude to make real-time decisions to exceed those minimums when conditions are right; they sure appear to be in Q4, so there's a little bit of judgment involved. Is it 50% or 55% or whatever that is, but we just need to make a call and over time, we'll have the ability to modulate that accordingly."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeanine Way Okay, .  for the detailed answer. I appreciate it."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeanine Way Maybe my second question, maybe for Mike. The well per foot, it decreased quarter-over-quarter in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. Would you characterize those decreases as sustainable for '22? And any color just on current inflation on your outlook for '22 would be helpful. For example, one of your peers mentioned earlier this week that they would adjust '22 activity is inflation warranted it. And I believe Lee said just now in his prepared remarks that 10% cost inflation would put pressure on the maintenance scenario and I didn't catch whether that meant on the 1.1. capex or if that meant on activity. ."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Henderson Yeah, Jeanine, I'll take that. I'll start with the expectation on the well costs for 2022. Well, it seems we're still working up on our bottoms-up planning and obviously as we noted the macro-environment's pretty dynamic at the moment. To highlight it's Third Quarter being the lowest quarter of the year, turned to CWC for foot costs in both Eagle Ford and Bakken. We're actually year-to-date down 12% from where we were in the 2020 on average. So what I'd see file that's probably going to be our starting point for '22 and similar to what you've seen in '21, we'll continue to progress opportunities to improve our cost structure. I think as we noted, we could improve -- should start to see some inflation in '22. On the inflation question, maybe a little bit more color there. Please start with '21, how it characterize dot inflation very much in check for '21. It's been largely confined into to steel and CTG. We have fully accounted for that and our capital, our $1 billion capital budget. As noted, we're working through '22 at the moment. And it seems reasonable to some modest inflation. I think I wouldn't highlight that. we are looking to take some actions. So for example, we secured some of our Reg frac [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible] requirements for next year. I think maybe the area where there's quite a bit of uncertainty is labor. But that's probably a broader issue economy-wide. So as we noted, we could see up to 10% inflation. I think that will depend on activity levels. But again, similar to '21, we're going to be working hard to mitigate and offset any of those cost pressures."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Tillman Yeah, Jeanine, maybe just around out to just for clarity. As I mentioned in my remarks, when you think about the benchmark case being predicated on really $50 WTI and that capital range that we provided that 1 to 1.1, I think applying that up to 10% to that range is what at least gets you in the correct zip-code under a maintenance scenario for 2022."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arun Jayaram . Mike and perhaps Lee, I wanted to get your thoughts on how you plan to lean on some of the basins outside of the Bakken and Eagle Ford. Obviously, in a lower commodity price environment that you guys have really focused on your core of the core inventory in both those plays. But how should we think about in a much better environment for oil gas and NGLs in capital allocation to place such as Oklahoma and the Permian?"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Tillman Yeah, Rin. This is Lee, I think consistent with how we talked about in the past, we do expect to be increasing our Oklahoma and Permian allocation up to that 20% to 30% range under again, a maintenance scenario. For reference, those two basins accounted for more like 10% of our allocation in 2021 this year. Clearly, all of the commodity prices are moving in a very constructive direction which really has the net effect of really lifting all boats even in our black oil plays of the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. And I think where we're really seeing the benefit of having that strength across the commodity complex is the fact that we have this very balanced portfolio already with about a 50 Percent exposure to oil and a 50% exposure to natural gas and NGL. So there's no -- our thinking hasn't changed. We believe there are extremely strong and competitive opportunities in both Permian and Oklahoma, the strengthening and NGL and gas has only served to elevate those further. But oil has also elevated the returns in our other basins as well. So we feel the strength of the balanced portfolio gives us that  exposure across the commodity complex."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arun Jayaram , . And Lee, my follow-up is maybe just to get some -- a bigger picture question for you on just U.S. resource basins. 2 of your larger peers in the Bakken, Ryan and Harold, have announced large multi-billion dollar transactions in the Permian and I want to get your thoughts on what this says about the Bakken. They're 2 of the larger operators in the Bakken -- in that basin, pardon me. And just how you're thinking about portfolio renewal. Pat gave us an update on the Rex program, but you do have some other inventory expansion opportunities within your existing basin so, wanted to see how you're thinking about portfolio renewal and some of the moves of some of your key peers in the basin."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Tillman Yeah, Arun. First of all, I would just start off by saying any transaction, any M&A work whether it'd be large or small, we're always going to view that through the lens of our very compelling organic case, our peer-leading financial delivery, and really a strict criteria that's predicated on financial accretion. And so that's really the filter that we are going to view any type of opportunity. The same discipline that we apply to our organic opportunities, we certainly are going to apply in the inorganic space. We believe obviously that the Bakken continues to offer exceptional returns. If you look at some of the material within our earnings deck, you will see that certainly in some of the appendix slides, just how competitive Bakken is relative to the other place here in the U.S. But for us it really, anything that we would look at inorganically would have to offer significant value. It would have to come in and move our full-cycle returns in the right direction. And that quite frankly is a very high margin today. You could argue that the M&A market has become a little bit more of a seller's market today with the commodity prices that we're experiencing. And with over 10 years of extremely strong inventory, we simply don't see the need to do anything dramatic in the market. Certainly not do anything that would be dilutive to our exceptional financial delivery. But however, having said that, our portfolio renewal -- what we have talked about in the past is that, embedded in that capital budget that we talked about each and every year, we have kind of up to about 10% of that dedicated to what we consider to be organic enhancement opportunities that could be things like redevelopment opportunity than the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. It could be things like the Texas Delaware oil play that Pat addressed in the opening remarks. And we want to make sure that we continue those programs on a consistent and sustainable basis. As we look out in those out years and make best attempts to continue to replace and replenish our inventory. I think the Texas Delaware oil play is a  example of some things that we were able to get into for very low entry cost. And now, certainly we see today a very clear path for that to compete for capital allocation. And we still have some work to do in terms of getting some longer dated production information from the spacing tests and we want to drive some learnings into the DMC program. But there's definitely a path there for that asset now to compete head-to-head with some of the best in our current portfolio. So hopefully, I addressed all of your questions, Arun. Did I miss anything?"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arun Jayaram Well, just maybe a quick follow-up, Lee. In terms of the Texas Delaware just on this topic of portfolio renewal, are you aware of any of your peers which are testing the play at this point?"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Pat Wagner Hi Arun, this is Pat. There have been some other tests, specifically to the south of us. There have been some Woodford test, but that area's a little bit lower pressure and not as thick. And then on the eastern side of the platform, there's been some Merrimack tests as well, but some of them have been okay. But again, not as good a pressure as ours. We think we absolutely have the best sweetest spot of the play where we have both Woodford and Merrimack stacked with good separation between them and we've had good results to-date, obviously."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Hanold .  all. I was wondering if you provided some good framework for 2022 and just to clarify a couple of things. One, obviously you're having a big uplift in oil production here in 4Q, should we think about the baseline maintenance cases, your average '21 oil production, or should we look more to the exit rate of where you might be this year and then on the capital spending concept, can you remind me within that circle, $1 to $1.1 billion dollars in capex, where does Rex capital fall within that? Is that included in that or would that be in addition?"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Tillman Yes. First of all on your first question, Scott. Yes, you should think about our -- a maintenance scenario in 2022 being calibrated to our average 2021 oil production. All of us experienced some variability quarter-to-quarter in our production numbers. It's natural in the short-cycle investments that as you see that natural variability. But again, we'd be looking at a maintenance scenario to drive toward that notional 172,000 barrels of oil per day. Your second question, Scott, around our capital spending number, even in the benchmark case of one-to-one one, That number is all inclusive and includes all of our investments, including Rex as well as any other organic enhancement opportunity. Just as the $1 billion budget did this year. I mean, one of the reason that saw a little bit of peak CapEx in third quarter was the impact of bringing the 3-well pad online in the Texas Delaware Oil Plant. So that is should be looked at as an all in number. There's nothing carved out and put on the side."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Hanold Okay. That's . Appreciate that. And pivoting back to shareholder returns. You guys obviously have a very robust buyback sitting in front of us. And it seems like that plus goosing up that fixed dividend over time, the plan. I know the answer is probably going to be, let's wait until we actually harvest some of this free cash flow. But as we look forward, even with the increased buyback authorization, it looks like you're going to eat to that pretty quickly next year if these commodity prices hold out. And as you continue to look forward, is the buybacks still going to be you're likely primary outlet for that or do you see any other opportunities going forward such as special or variable dividends in the mix as you look longer-term bigger picture?"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Tillman I do think Scott clearly, when you look at the potential financial delivery in 2022, we have a unique opportunity just as we did in fourth quarter to not only deliver against the minimum of 40% back to equity holders but to actually exceed that. But again, that's going to be calibrated to real-time cash flow from operations and that will be something that we'll watch closely. I think Dane did a  job of laying out the mechanics, but I also wanted to stress one thing we've been really clear on. We developed our framework to really give the investor confidence in the quantum. The quantum of cash we were going to get back to shareholders. And we knew that that would be a competitive and sustainable base dividend plus something else. That something else clearly today, is share repurchases. But we didn't. We purposefully and intentionally didn't limit ourselves to a potential delivery mechanism. We wanted to keep that flexibility going forward. But as Dane said, in the current environment, the impact of a steadying rateable share repurchase program going forward makes the absolute most sense today."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate , guys.  for getting me on the call this morning. Fellows, I want to ask you about how the inventory view has changed given the backdrop in the commodity. What I'm thinking is given gas in particular, Mid-Continent, does that compete better, does it change the view of capital allocation? And what I'm really trying to get to is going back to your comments, we at the beginning of the year, I think was Mike actually that talked about in the maintenance scenario, you would drill half your high quality inventory in five-years because at the end of the day that's  ultimately what's going to dictate how the market perceives your free cash flow yield."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Tillman Yeah. I think stepping back from the inventory, we've talked about, the er than a decade of capital efficient high return inventory that it's really been based on nominally our $50 WTI men's cycle view. As actual prices move around that planning basis, clearly that has an impact on maturing of those opportunities and may in fact even bring additional opportunities into the economic window. So it is a very dynamic thing, but we set that planning basis on conservatively so we could give a very conservative and strong v iew of just how our inventory can deliver in a more modest pricing environment. To your question around how the -- the commodity's strengthening particularly the secondary products of gas and NGL alter our investment decisions. Look, we're a return driven Company, as we look at individual opportunities, we're going to be driven by -- by economics. I won't say we're completely agnostic to the product mix but at the end of the day, it's not about barrels it's about dollars and we're going to be driven by selecting the most economic opportunities across all of our core play and then putting those into our business plan and executing efficiently against them. So, it's strictly an economic decision. And although I'm thrilled that the gas and NGL has recovered, I'm equally as thrilled that oil is sitting at above the $80 mark as well because that tends to uplift really all of our portfolio, because although we have an oil weighted portfolio, it is a very balanced portfolio. And so we are in essence taking advantage of those secondary product pricings at a portfolio level, but our individual capital allocation decisions are going to be driven by economics."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate I appreciate that. Maybe this is a quick footnote to that, Lee for Guy perhaps. I think at dynamic inventory, some visibility [Indiscernible] would be really helpful because it would get a lot of [Indiscernible] away from the idea of that there's an inventory challenge [Indiscernible] with the commodity deck, just [Indiscernible] maybe a footnote. But my follow-up real quick is on Slide 7 and I -- you have been early on very clear about your views on the business model. And again, I congratulate you on leading market on that [Indiscernible] complete appears. But nevertheless, on Slide 7 you still talk about in a er than $60 WTI environment our production grew with cap that underscores the commitment to discipline. The issue is the 5% growth is not part of your rhetoric today. So when do you decide is the right time to go back to growing production?"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Tillman Yeah, I think that that was simply as you stated, a way for us to set up a bright line on the framework that there is a very, very high hurdle for growth. We will always be informed by the macro, but at the end of the day, it's all about delivering outsized financial metrics when we're above $60. To the extent that we see that some moderate growth would fit into that financial framework, it would become a consideration, but it still remains more of an output of our financial model as opposed to an input. And I think given the past history of the sector, it's very important for us to demonstrate clearly that in a very constructive oil price environment that we can deliver out-sized financial outcomes relative to alternative investments. Because the reality is that we know there will be future volatility and we have to be able to, within that volatility offer competitive returns when prices are lower. So it's really just step there to really put it in the framework, acknowledge it. I think today we would say the need to drive to a number, even in that 5% range, we just don't see that today and it's hard to see it even in the near future."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Neal Dingmann Morning all. My question has been asked. I want to ask about just on the plan for next year. Does that basically assume is part of this total activity about the same percentage of Eagle Ford and Bakken activity. I know you run those 2 consistent except for the last few quarters and I'm wondering if that's still the plans for next year?
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Tillman Yes. Neal, obviously, we have not released our budget for next year. We're still speaking in hypothetical terms around maintenance budget. But when you consider the fact that we will have incremental capital flowing to Oklahoma and Permian, we would expect obviously, that some of that capital would be coming out of Eagle Ford and the Bakken to make room for that. But I would just say stay tuned, we'll get into a lot more detail at an asset level of allocation when we get out to the budget release in February."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neal Dingmann Okay. No, [Indiscernible] assume that and then just a follow-up really encouraged like the comments on that Slide 14 about the resource play. I'm just wondering maybe could you comment for you on the guidance as far as how much further do you think you could push this in terms of pad size completion, some other things obviously the results -- early results here are very encouraging especially as you all pointed out when you compare into some of the Delaware, I'm just wondering so where we go from here?"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Pat Wagner Hi, Neal. This is Pat. Our primary objective is this pad has the spacing. And so right now we drilled this at a spacing of more wells per zone. We drilled 2 in the Woodford and 1 at the Bareback. So far we're seeing no interference at all between those. There is the 700 foot thickness between the 2. So we're going to give some more longer-term production on this pad and see how these wells perform. And if so, then we'll 4 by 4 [Indiscernible] development scenario. However, I think we have some opportunities to test that even further. We've obviously drilled 9 wells now, so we've had a lot of learnings on the drilling and [Indiscernible] inside.  Hard to give any details on that, but we continue to refine our approach to that. I think we'll continue to drive our costs down as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as we go into '22, we'll continue to progress our learning there and see what else we need to do to take this thing ultimately [Indiscernible] call."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Pat Wagner  for your remarks. . Our final question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Gruber Yes. . The key equity income was raised was  to see, expected, but still good to see. Cash dividends from EG was $47 million, but I believe those lagged the booking of income. Can you speak how we should think about cash flow back to Marathon from your equity interest in EG and in the quarters ahead in terms of the pace and magnitude?"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dane Whitehead Hi, Scott, this is Dane. Yes, so for our EG investments that are accounted for on the equity method, excuse me. I think over time it's fair to expect that cash dividends match equity income. Quarter-to-quarter, they don't always match. The timing can vary, especially in periods where you have significant changes, like a bid run-up in prices that we saw in Q3. And so in this case, dividends lagged earnings fairly significantly in Q3. We expect that to catch up in the reasonable near future. So I think when you're modeling, it's probably just -- there going to be equal -- pretty much equal over time. But you can expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Gruber I got you. A little bit to your point where cash dividends, at least in the near-term exceed equity income or is it just on a lagged basis? Is there a catch-up here --"
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Dane Whitehead Yeah. We're we certainly can see a catch-up where the dividends exceed equity earnings in the next period.
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Gruber And then just thinking about cash taxes, you guys have a large NOL. But can you remind us, do you have U.S. cash taxes ramping up within your five-year outlook, Given better earnings out at the front end, there's the five-year outlook for cash taxes [Indiscernible]."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dane Whitehead  on by the asset. And so we do have significant tax attributes in the form of NOL has the big one $8.2 billion and then foreign tax credits as well. Both of which of course will be used to offset future taxes. Our outlook, even at forward pricing doesn't have us paying federal income taxes until the latter part of the decade. And that really hasn't changed. The outlook is durable. We tested against commodity prices, a higher corporate tax rates, changes to the IDC tax treatments really don't have a meaningful impact on accelerating cash tax ability. So I think that answer hasn't changed over the past few quarters."
4465443,Marathon Oil Corporation,MRO,11/4/2021,CEO Lee Tillman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dane Whitehead Okay. . That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Lee Tillman for final comments.  for your interest in Marathon Oil and I'd like to close by again, thanking all of our dedicated employees and contractors for their commitment to safely and responsibly deliver the energy the world need each and every day. . , ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.  for your participation. You may now disconnect."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Halloran So let's start on the guide, and how you guys are thinking about the fourth quarter coming up year sales. Obviously, if you feel good about what the demand conditions look like, you're layering on some acquisitions here. 3Q was a good quarter in terms of performance, feels like maybe the margins on an organic basis are a little lower than what the sequential trend would imply. So maybe some commentary on how you're thinking about that as you move into the fourth quarter, and certainly correct me if I have the wrong assumption there."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Mike, as of -- our guidance, as you heard, is taking the midpoint of our prior guidance of by $20 million. You can think about it being 2/3 M&A and 1/3 is organic. In this current environment, we continue to be prudent, based on the overall supply chain environment noise of situation that you hear out there. In addition, just to point out, ITS margins in Q4, 2020 were up for 400 basis points reaching 26% margins. What our guidance here implies is that even with all the inflation, discretionary spend, increases and investments, we're going to be kind of flattish in margin expansion year-over-year, which speaks to all the  actions that the teams continued to execute, and puts that segment to a very solid margin performance in this environment, we believe. And PST margins for the core business, which is kind of excluding the M&A that we said is EBITDA decretive but gross margin accretive. And some of the accelerated Hydrogen investment that we're doing based on that frame order that we just received. The EBITDA margin profile still is in the 30's kind of range, which we view as quite healthy given the top comps on medical shipments in 2020, as well as the inflation and discretionary investment that we have done here in 2021 and still do -- plan to do in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about that, and at the same time, prudent in terms of how we see supply chain out there."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Halloran Since -- If I'm hearing you right, you're not implying that the market headwinds accelerate for you on the margin line 3Q to 4Q in terms of supply chain logistics, labor, transportation, expenses, things like that."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vik Kini Yes, Mike, I wouldn't -- No, I think what [Indiscernible] saying is exactly in line with how you're interpreting it. Clearly, obviously, a lot of those same headwinds persist into Q4. But like we've been doing, we think we've kind of taken prudent pricing actions to kind of remain in line with offsetting those headwinds, much like you saw in Q3. So I think in that respect we see Q4 fairly comparable to Q3 in terms of price mitigating the inflationary risks."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Halloran Got you. And then on the order side, obviously really strong orders, good to see. Maybe some thoughts on what types of orders, those are -- those more short cycle in nature or is this just a kind of MRO short-cycle type move or are you starting to see some more project or CapEx type orders coming through the funnel as well. Obviously, you highlighted the hydrogen, but I'm thinking a little bit more broadly."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Yes, I think, Mike, we're seeing kind of both. We see sustainable momentum on the short-cycle. And actually what we see is, long-cycle accelerating that some projects are getting released. The hydrogen being one, but o thers like, the bio-gas, is a very substantial project too as well. We're pretty pleased with what we're seeing. At the same time I can tell you that we're -- with the level of technologies that we have across our portfolio, you're going to hear a lot more about this during Investor Day is how we're able to pretty quickly, reallocate technologies to some of those end markets that are seeing some meaningful growth. And with the level of agility that we have in our business, it's positioned really well to capture the tailwind from any of those markets and continue to see that continue to sustain momentum in the order rates."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joe Ritchie Maybe to staying with orders, obviously, clearly incredibly strongest quarter. I'm just curious, are you starting to hear this more CapEx decisions being made, Vicente, where your customers are looking to deploy a little bit more CapEx in this environment that's give n, given the supply chain, is been fairly unprecedented in what we're experiencing today, or is this -- is it predominantly still a lot of OpEx that's coming through here?"
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Joe, we're definitely hearing a lot more on the CapEx too as well. And when we hear about CapEx, it really has to do with ESG and sustainability. And it's exciting to see that a lot of the older technologies, the majority of our technologies are enablers and beneficiary for ESG. And I think the exciting thing here is that, compressors can reduce energy consumption and you can see how energy has really radically increased across mainland Europe and even also China. So whether compressors, blowers and back-ends, we have always spoken a lot about our energy efficiency. And so I think customers are starting to make the move based on the targets that they set up themselves to be by achieving by 2020, 2030 and 2050. So I think a lot of this is really seem some -- it's going to see, it can still continue momentum in my view."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joe Ritchie Got it. That's helpful. And I guess just maybe if you could just parse out that pricing commentary a little bit more. I'd be curious to hear how positive the price cost equation was this quarter, what the expectation is through the end of the year, and then as we head into 2022, should we continue to see pretty decent price cost benefit coming through your numbers?"
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vik Kini Yes. Sure, Joe, I'll take that one. So in the context of Q3, price realization was a little bit in excess of 3% across the entire enterprise, which obviously speaks to the healthy performance and frankly the proactive measures that frankly, all of our business is taking. Pricing did slightly outweigh inflation in Q3, so we were price-cost positive in the context of Q3, we would expect to be at fairly comparable of that equation in Q4. Now it is worth noting obviously that not unexpectedly inflation, obviously, headwind have risen in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We always expected that, and that's why we got ahead a lot of the pricing actions. Again, we're quite pleased with the performance and the momentum that we're seeing. As we think about 2022, frankly, a little bit too early to start guiding on numbers just yet, but obviously, we would expect to see healthy carryover on the pricing actions. I'd say the majority of the pricing actions that we have taken are, our list price oriented. So obviously, it should be inherently a little bit stickier. But obviously, we do obviously have some carryover inflation that, we will be dealing with into 2022, as well. So we're -- we'll reserve commentary just yet on the price cost equation into 2022. But I think we're quite encouraged by the actions the team has taken to still say, price cost positive in the context of the second half of this year."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nigel Coe . , guys. Just wanted to attack on the back of that question, inflation. Just how do you define inflation? Do you just look at the direct input costs, the materials, is that labor and a board, definition increasing freight? That'll be interesting to hear. But just curious on obviously the orders very strong. Can you maybe talk about where we are on the revenue synergy capture from the merger? Obviously, you put together a much more balanced portfolio showing some clear synergies across the product. So, just wondering if some of this order strength is seeing some of the synergies come through?"
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Yeah, I'll draw on the second question around the orders in terms of revenue synergies coming from the transaction, yes, we're definitely seeing some of that. You're going to hear more on some of the case stories that we will show you during the Investor Day. But clearly we're very pleased with how our oil-free compressor product line is moving, how air treatment -- a lot of good momentum that with a little product that we have launched and through the multichannel, multi-brand strategy that we have on a global basis is really giving us some good tailwinds on that."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nigel Coe And secondly, on the Investor Day, you said longer-term target, just wondering, are we looking here at sort of three-year targets, but not 2022?"
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Vik Kini That's correct. We'll be talking about we'll call 2025 targets in the framework to think about. And then we will formally guide 2022 when we do our next earnings call.
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Sprague . , everyone. Maybe just coming back one more on cost also I would've guessed, actually you might need more than 3% price to offset inflation. So I'm just wondering if in that direct materials, I would assume you are including, you're kind of sourcing and merger-related benefits. Sure, it gets harder and harder to kind of separate those with the passage of time. But maybe just update us where you're at on that, and what role that's playing in helping you battle the inflation here."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vik Kini Just to be clear and put a finer point on it. The pricing number you're going to see in the cue when it's issued tomorrow, right around 3.4%- 3.5% kind of net across the entire enterprise. Fairly comparable numbers between ITS and PST. And in the context of what I was speaking to in terms of that covering inflationary headwinds, we're not incorporating, let's call it any of the merger related synergies, or anything of that, into that equation. You're right, it does become a bit of a score keeping exercise, but we've been pretty disciplined and prudent to keep those buckets separate, in terms of how we actually manage and run the organization. So things like some of the direct material productivity or some of the innovative value. Those are separate, and I will say, as we said at the beginning of the call, we're still on track to deliver the kind of the year 2 synergies as part of the merger, which was the $100 million number that we committed to."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Sprague That's  to hear. . And then just on the new M&A, you gave us the total additional revenue contribution. But would you mind just checking through those 3, what the annualized revenue of each one of those are?"
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vik Kini Sure. I can absolutely do that. So in terms of the 3 acquisitions that we've kind of spoken to here, which are Air Dimensions, Tuthill Pumps, and Lawrence Factor. Air Dimensions is a low double-digit right around $10 million to $12 million in annualized revenue. The Tuthill Pumps is in the mid-20s in terms of 25 which is probably a good number to use. And Lawrence Factor is relatively small. It's a $6 million purchase price, which is actually very comparable to the revenue base and mid-single-digits, about $5 million, but very exciting technology on air sampling and aftermarket offerings that we think we can leverage very highly within our IPS portfolio."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julian Mitchell Hi. . Maybe just -- . Maybe just circling back on aggregate incremental margin or operating leverage. So it's running in the sort of mid-20s, firm-wide, I think the back half of this year. Understand the cost constraints, and new acquisitions coming in affecting that. But as you look at next year, how quickly, I guess, do we see that operating leverage move back into the 30s. Do you think something that can happen fairly quickly, or it's just too early to tell given these acquisitions that just come in and given the cost environment is moving around quite quickly?"
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vik Kini Yes. I think that the latter part of your statement's probably true. I think obviously we're working through our views on 2022 and the annual budgeting process as you would expect right now. I think it's a little too early to call. I think the view right now is the first half of 2022. Obviously, we're still going to be facing some of the same dynamics we're facing now with regards to some of the inflationary headwinds, and obviously we have the pricing momentum to continue to offset some of that, if not all of that. And then frankly, yes, we will be continuing to integrate a lot of those acquisitions. So, I think given t he carryover price, as well as the continued inflation into 2022, and then frankly, the synergy expectations for the base business, because we shouldn't forget that we still have the third year of the merger-related synergies as well as the integration nationally acquired assets. We would expect to continue to see that trend improve as we move through 2022 based on kind of what we can see now and get more client closer to web. Let's call it that 30 – ish percent type number that we've been seeing across the segments, if not a little bit healthier. But I'd say right now, the specific timing of exact cadence is something we're working through. And I think we'll give a bit more color as we do our next earnings call and formal guidance for 2022."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julian Mitchell . And then just on the capital deployment, so yes, about a billion dollars of deployed sort of M&A funds this year. Maybe when you look at sort of across those acquisitions or you can call out one or two specific ones or more interested in maybe the total deployment, what do you think the 3 or 5 year return, sort of metric should be on those billion dollars or so that you have deployed? And if there's maybe 1 or 2 acquisitions in particular where you think the margin expansion should be above average. Now that they are all once, they're integrated into Ingersoll."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal I think, Julian, we should definitely expect to see that, kind of low double-digit to mid-teen ROIC return on these transactions. We always said that that is a financial criteria that we have in our deals. We're still finding  transactions that, are highly complementary from technology, from commercial acumen, and all of that. And still be able to provide a good financial outcome based on a lot of post-synergy activities that we can do."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julian Mitchell And then any sort of color Vicente on specific transactions that, you think offer above-av erage sort of margin expansion scope."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Well, one that I'll say comes to mind right now, for sure, SEEPEX, right? When we acquired SEEPEX, we said that was a mid-teens EBITDA. But we see that business to be way like a segment level to PST. So that is a tremendous margin expansion. Also, on the ITS, the recently acquired -- the recently signed transaction on Tuthill Pumps. When you think about the prior Tuthill, I mean, it was a phenomenal margin expansion, so we still expect that to see some good momentum on expanding that. So, I think really across the Board, the Board, in a lot of the transactions we expect to see some good meaningful expansion. Clearly, when you look at Maximus that is already acquired at PST difficult than that. And also, Air Dimensions, that is in the 50s, more difficult to continue spanning on that. And those tend to be, then focus more on the organic growth opportunities that we see, as we look into our commercial global footprint to expand the growth there."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andy Kaplowitz You said that you've really been pushing hard into some of these newer markets over the last couple of years, lab life sciences, water, animal health, which obviously is leading to that 35% order growth in 20% revenue, growth in PST that you saw. If we look back Gardner Denver is all medical business at average, I think something like mid-single-digit growth, but given the sort of niche focus of PST and what seems like higher-growth markets. Is it fair to say the PST could average higher than mid-single-digits as you go into '22 and beyond?"
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Yes. Absolutely. I think we feel really compelled on that. I mean, I think as you said, old investments that we're doing are paying off in terms of, redirecting into these very niche markets and commanding some good, strong leadership positions, launching a lot of new product. You're going to hear a lot more about that also on the Investors Day, on how the cadence of new product has just been accelerated dramatically. Even during the COVID days, the team accelerated the new? [Indiscernible]product development and we're seeing that come through for? [Indiscernible] here now and into next year."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andy Kaplowitz . And then maybe a little bit more color into what's going on regionally for you guys, particularly in China. It looks like you had a really strong compressor growth in China, and I know it's one of your key initiatives for the combined Company, but the rest of APAC orders were down a little bit in compressors. So maybe just talk about regionally, what's going on, particularly in Asia."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Andy, I think we're incredibly pleased with how the team continues to execute in Asia-Pacific and particularly in China. And what we saw quarter-over-quarter, Q2 to Q3, we saw actually the momentum of orders really accelerate in China, which is kind of contradictory through some of the things that you hear out there in other companies. So, it speak to a lot of the self-help initiatives that the team is doing. We spoke about relaunching the Gardner Denver compressors, which obviously has proven to be a tremendous success into -- and that was something that we always said we were super excited about, the combination of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver because we could have a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy, particularly in China. The team has just done a phenomenal job, leveraging the [ Indiscernible] initiative and an action to then relaunch an entire product portfolio with Gardner Denver. The second piece is Blowers and Vacuums. Blowers and vacuums was fairly small piece in China. And again, I think the team is putting a lot of good dedication and localizing and really penetrating some of the end-markets that we have seen are good in terms of applications in other regions. The rest of Asia-Pacific, I can maybe split it between emerging and developing, like Australia, for example. And that's still continued to perform fairly well, where we saw a little bit of softness was on the emerging as countries like Vietnam or Philippines was created on a lot of shutdowns due to COVID. But again, that's a fairly small portion of our business. Therefore, China overcoming some of that decline still drive meaningful growth in the quarter for Asia-Pacific."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rob Wertheimer Hi, . Vicente, I'd love to hear if you have any more color on how IRX was applied to supply chain issues that maybe rose and [Indiscernible] through the quarter, and switched the quarterly cadence upper or are added to the process of anyway, and then maybe just the outflow of that. We had a few unexpected cost surprises across industrial first quarter, you guys avoided that entirely. I'm curious if you think that the risk of unexpected surprises is nil because you've got a handle on it or whether it lasts another few months, whether you see more and more issues pop up that you have to dea l with, or whether it's stable, just general outlook on supply chain over the next couple of quarters if you would. ."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Absolutely.  there. I mean, so I can tell you that definitely things will continue to pop up. And even though -- clearly based on the results, you can see how we have overcome. It really speaks to a lot of  work that everyone is doing. And I will say,  work supported by IRX and the process and the tool that we use. So we have definitely leveraged the IRX tool as you know, it's a very high cadence, high touch mechanism that we used to just accelerate how we execute and reprioritize the teams to the critical items. And that has allowed us to create this massive agility and nimbleness, even though obviously, we're a fairly large global Company and allows us to really redirect the teams, do the proper priorities that are happening out there. So for example, we leveraged IRX when logistics was a major issue. And you could go say, for example, into a factor you can see how IRX to tool we were leveraging to track the backlog of containers that we needed to fulfill and acquire as an example. I mean as simple as that could be. But now we're leveraging the IRX to prioritize the suppliers and the commodities that we need to go after. And again, that daily, weekly cadence of ensuring that the team has continued to see a good momentum and good perspective. It's really what's giving us the outcome that you see here. So I think as we continue, I mean, we think we live in a very dynamic world that we'll continue to see some maybe challenges. But that's why we have always said that agility and nimbleness is going to be a core competitive advantage, follow through the use of IRX as a tool to really execute, is just giving us that  sense of comforts zone that the teams will be able to continue to perform well."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Josh Pokrzywinski Just a question on -- I guess a question on compressor orders. I understand there's some virtuous [Indiscernible] going on there, but any idea of where those stand on, kind of the historical basis like, are we at all-time highs on compressor orders today? Obviously, there's a lot of new pieces of the portfolio and the combination. And what do you think the market has done sort of relative to you guys? Because apparently there is a recovery going on, but I would imagine that with some of the IRX tools you're gaining a lot of shares well."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Yes, George, I think in terms of compressor orders, we're definitely way above 2019 levels. And one could think that, it could be at a record level. We haven't done and going backwards to -- with the combined companies to really reassess if these record levels or not, but we haven't done that. We're just focused on, continue to execute and take solid market share. So in terms of against what we see in the market, I think we continue to position ourselves as a premium provider of compressor products. You see that we're focused on not only in the growth, but also on the profitability. So we believe in profitable growth is one of our key drivers and enablers for us. And with a unique differentiation that we're launching, in terms of technologies that reduced total cost of ownership and  energy reductions, I think that is what has positioned us really well to continue to take some share and continue to launch products that help with that. One example, the team in Europe, the CompAir teams has launched a new compressor. Very large, fairly sizable compressor that has some radical new technology, and it is one of the most efficient compressors of that size and power in the market today. So, a lot of continued innovation is really what is driving the momentum in my view. And because we're able to deliver some differentiated value to the customers, then we're able to continue to command that -- the price positioning that we have in the mar ket."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Josh Pokrzywinski That's helpful. I guess, maybe just following up on that last comment on kind of the pricing power and pricing to value. It seems like steel could start to becoming down here. Can't help but notice the average Ingersoll Rand product, particularly in the ITS portfolio, has an awful lot of ferrous content in it. If steel prices say got cut in half, what sort of cost tailwind would that be to you guys? Because I would imagine that pricing stays fairly sticky in that environment."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal  point there, Josh. Definite pricing are very sticky, and as we look forward, and commodities continue to get stabilized, yes, we should see that margin progression to even accelerate. Not only from the commodity, but also as we continue to execute a lot of the I2B initiatives that we have in our funnel. So we're overcoming the current market situation fairly well. In my opinion, I guess, again,  to the team in leveraging the tools that we have like a IRX, but as this current inflationary market continue -- subsides at some point in time in 2022, we should see earnings power to accelerate."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nicole Deblase So we've been through a lot here, but I guess I just have a few pretty brief ones. First, just a clarification. I think you talked about, Vik like, 30% PST margins in the fourth quarter, but that was organic. Is the drag from M&A expected to be pretty similar to 3Q? I know you have some more deals folding in, in the fourth quarter."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vik Kini That's , just to be clear, that's 30% online unlock all the base business. Obviously the overall -- because you have a full quarter now off the acquisitions, primarily SEEPEX, which you only had 1 month of in the Q3. So the overall margin profile for PST, it will be dilutive, obviously, upfront here. You're thinking kind of more on in the upper 20s range. That's probably a probably decent proxy or maybe a little bit more dilutive than the impact you saw discretely in Q3 just because of the full-quarter impact at SEEPEX. But to the [Indiscernible] point here, the [Indiscernible] views on the SEEPEX is as gross margin accretive business. So obviously there's meaningful synergy opportunity that admittedly, you're going to see us start to execute on very shortly here into 2022 onward."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nicole Deblase Got it, , Vik. And then secondly, on the synergy profile, I know no change to the $300 million full run rate synergies. But are you guys still expecting to do about $50 million incremental in 2022? I'm just thinking about all the big puts and takes in the walk into next year."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vik Kini Definitely a lot of puts and takes. But, Nicole, at this point, that's correct. Just to re-calibrate, $115 million was delivered in 2020, we expect a $100 million this year, $50 million next year, and then the tail which will be $35 million into 2023. At this point in time, nothing's really changed in terms of that phasing. And clearly as we move into 2022 and onwards, I'd say I2V and the footprint components of that equation are probably the more prominent drivers of the synergy profile, moving forward."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Markus Mittermaier Yes. Hi, , everyone. I wanted to --"
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Markus Mittermaier Hey, hi, . Follow-up on George 's question, if I may, on compressor orders in -- if I look at that particularly compared to your large European peers, they're quite impressive. And this has been going on for few quarters now. I wonder if it's product, is this channel, is this -- you guys may be managing availability better. I think if you could elaborate on that, that would be . And then connected to that, how much visibility do you have into the backlog? Obviously, at these massive order intake numbers, there could be some concerns that some customers, just for the build slots, I just wonder the risk of [Indiscernible] how do you adjust that?"
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Markus, in terms of the first question about the compressors orders, I'll tell you that it's a little bit of everything. It's definitely the product, because again, how we are leveraging the entire product portfolio across multiple brands, it is also the channel. And I think this is a  lead question Markus, as we go into to the Investors Day, because we have case studies actually that we will show you on how we have expanded our channel to really  accelerated growth, and also reposition the product to really accelerated growth. So I think it has to do with a lot of the work that we have done since the product summits. If you remember, back in the -- I don't know, about a year ago we spoke a lot about product summit and how the team, so it's just being very thoughtful way and then executed with the use of IRX to really reposition a lot of the products on the channel with out creating any conflict. I think that has proven to be a pretty successful recipe. Availability in some products has been actually quite good. I saw that team is marketing for [Indiscernible] and Blowers that we have one of the best lead times and how that is accelerating now even the momentum as they see here in the fourth quarter. To your question in terms of visibility of backlog, customers for compressors, because you have to customize many times the options to the specific application. There's not a lot of pre -order that can be done on compressors, just because of the optionality. And the visibility that we have in the backlog in the compressors is really on the more larger compressor, the multistage centrifugal compressor that are -- we positioned that as more long-cycle business. And those -- when we're doing a contract with a customer, we have caveats where we could actually pass or surcharge any specific cost increases that we're seeing through the supply chain in this environment. So I think we feel that we're doing everything that we can to protect ourselves in case that, obviously, inflation continues to stay at this level and commodities do not go down. But I think we feel good in terms of how we're protecting ourselves from a cost position."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Markus Mittermaier That's very helpful, . And just a very brief follow-u to that last comments, so that's 40% increased backlog, which is probably related to those longer cycle orders. You could, if you have to re-price that, understand that write-off."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal Kind of the [Indiscernible] I'll say it one more point there, Markus. I mean, we track pricing on bookings, so we know we have a really  leading indicator on how that backlog is doing against the price increases that we have done."
4465448,Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s,IR,11/4/2021,CEO Vicente Reynal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vicente Reynal . And we have no further questions registered. So hand the call back to Vicente for closing remarks. Vicente, over to you. . I just want to say  for the interest in Ingersoll Rand. I know that many of our employees are participating in the call. I also see that many of our employees from the new acquisitions are on the call. So I just want to say one more time, welcome to those of you that are new. Exciting to have everyone on board, exciting that how very thankful for everything that all of you are doing every day to make life better for our customers, our employees, our communities, and obviously our shareholders. So with that, we'll leave it here for now, and talk to you soon. .  to everyone who has joined us today. This concludes the call and you may now disconnect your lines."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rod Lache Was hoping maybe you could, first of all, clarify a little bit more what drove the 61% decremental on the volume in SNPS. And more importantly, if we take a step back and we think about for the overall Company for the year that the $310 million of supply chain and COVID cost and the effect -- the commodity costs of $195 million. Can you talk about what the prospects are for recovering that if they did remain elevated? So, any thoughts on how to kind of frame that."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark And Rod, this is Kevin. I'll take the second part of your question. I would break our activities to offset into 4 or 5 buckets. So, as we always do, we're constantly reassessing, reevaluating our cost structure and looking for opportunities both within supply chain, outside of supply chain to further reduce costs. We're in active negotiations with the supply base. Situations like this, I guess one of the side benefits is, becoming much more strategic with your customers as it relates to supply chain, as well as more strategic with your supply base, which translates into quite frankly, fewer supplier relationships, deeper supplier relationships, more strategic supplier relationships which provide you with the opportunity to further optimize the supply chain and reduce costs. I think in the past we've talked about over a 100 program or product redesign activities that we have underway. We we're substituting alternative inputs to platform solutions that will further lower those costs. And lastly, but equally important, we're having active discussions with all of our customers with respect to the cost of doing business in today's environment and the support we've provided to ensure that they remain connected from a supply standpoint. So those would be the 4 major buckets I would categorize things. Then I would say as it relates to cost and cost structure, and it's important consistent with past, we continue to have -- to invest in growth opportunities, technologies that support growth opportunities in areas like software, in areas like active safety, in areas like high-voltage electrification, and think it's important to continue to do so even in light of the decremental margins that you talked about to do production interruptions."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rod Lache So maybe just to put a finer point on that, do you have a view on the extent to which this could be mitigated through those four actions? It's a pretty big number in aggregate, obviously."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joseph Massaro Yeah, there is. We're working through that and as a part of our guidance for 2022, we'll talk about it. I think it's safe to say that you don't mitigate all of it in a 12-month timeframe, so there will be some amount of working through it. But as focused as we are on developing innovative solutions, we're, we have teams as, as focused on lowering overall costs."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rod Lache Okay. And just second, the growth over market all year has been much stronger than you expected it was -- I think it was 16% in the first half now 18% this quarter. Have you been able to sort of assess the extent to which this is -- obviously a lot of it is secular with high-voltage and Active safety, but there's some component of that which is just driven by production mix and what OEMs have done to prioritize certain vehicles. Have you been able to parse that out just to get a sense of what the trajectory really underlying this has been?"
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark I think it's tough -- I -- we ll, I think that -- I think it's a , a fair question. I think it's tough to do. In reality, we've -- over the last few years, we've seen accelerated demand for AF solutions, for high-voltage electrification, and other items. I think it's a little bit -- it's difficult to be precise or to precisely answer that question. Like Joe in the past has spoken to the fact that OEM customers, it appears as though are producing an overall richer product mix. But to the extent that's driven from the current supp ly chain crisis versus some of it's the overall trend in adoption of Aptiv safety high-voltage electrification, it's less than precise calculus."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joseph Spak . . Joe, just --  for all the updated color again on all the costs. I am just -- if I track this and I know you usually give it all on a year-over-year basis and sometimes a little bit sequentially, but is it -- it seems like if I back into just for the fourth quarter that COVID and [Indiscernible] supply chain [Indiscernible]. That's relatively flattish year-over-year. Is that fair and is that what is causing maybe a little bit of the better margin sequentially third quarter to fourth quarter?"
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joseph Massaro We do start to lap at Joe, so we had 40 million of supply chain disruption costs in Q4 of last year. You are right, we are picking up a lap where for the first 3 quarters of this year it was -- at specific to supply chain disruption costs. For the first time we're really incurring anything at that level. And then just thinking out a little bit here with everything going on and lessons learned and as we sort of turned to the cash, like you mentioned, the higher inventory. Is that something that is going to be a little bit more structural for you? That everyone sort of in the value chain will sort of carry a little bit more inventory, provide a little bit more buffer and"
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joseph Spak weighing on working capital a little bit. And then, on CapEx, I know that sort of came down or flex down and I think you normally talk about 5% of sales. So, should we expect like a catch-up next year for some of that might have been deferred or delayed or does it just return more towards that?"
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joseph Massaro So, Joe, on capex, there was a small push into next year. [Indiscernible] -- I think that 5% as an overall range is still good. There's been years we've been a little under, there will be years where we're a little over by not more than half a base, a half percentage point. I still think 5 is a good proxy. There has been a little movement around just as we work through some of the disruptions in the volume comeback, [Indiscernible], but I wouldn't say that's a material change. On inventory, to Kevin's point, I think we're learning a lot. There is a fair amount if you just looked at sort of normalized our inventory, about half of the increase balance is, I would describe as really transactional. Production came down really fast in the back half of Q3. We were obviously given lead times. We were -- we had inventory on hand to produce to the original schedules. That half I would describe as more transactional. Volume came down. We have higher inventory levels. We tend to be -- we tend to use the same inventory if you think about what we make resins for connectors, the electric distribution business, the chips we'll use to the extent we have them. So, it's more of a timing related to the production slip outs for about half that balance. To Kevin's point on the remaining balance, There is inventory on hand because lead times have extended. We're focused on making sure we have stock in some cases, you're -- if you've got a product that has 350 parts and you're waiting for one chip, you tend to have the other 349 in stocks, so you're ready to go once you get that chip. So, there's -- there's that type. But certainly, the full investment that you see on the balance sheet, now, I would not think is representative of the investment that needs to be made, going forward. To Kevin's point, there probably will be some, but it's not going to be at that level. That was -- half of that was really the production disruptions."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Kelley Hey, , team.  for taking my questions. Just 3Q outgrowth, another robust quarter here and realizing we aren't guiding to 2022, but you did reference in the slide decks and sustained growth over market opportunity. Can you talk about some of the drivers into next year, the content mix electrification, and how you're  thinking about those relative to the steeper hurdle we're going to see into 2022?"
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joseph Massaro The drivers, they're very consistent with what we've been seeing. It's high-voltage and active safety of clearly leaders. SPS continues to benefit more broadly from the content ads into vehicles. Even if it's not our active safety system or other technology, that business has content on 1 out of every 3.5 vehicles manufactured globally. So, there's a really positive content tailwind there. And then the commercial vehicle and industrial businesses continue to be accretive to growth. We're having a really good year from a commercial vehicle perspective and would expect the product lines in that space to continue to grow and be accretive to growth over market."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Kelley Okay. Got it. . And then maybe a question on the semi costs. You noted specifically driver of the higher AS and UX input costs, can you give a bit more color on the semi-impact in the quarter, and I guess going into next year, do you see further semi price increases on the horizon, and just curious how you're thinking about the potential price increases versus some of the offsets that you referenced?"
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joseph Massaro Yeah. Obviously still a lot of work in process as it relates to semiconductor pricing. It tends to be the price increases we're seeing now are really two-fold. We have seen some price increases on what I'll call the constrained chips. That I think will continue into next year. The other thing we're seeing at the moment, and I'd describe it as a bit of a sort of spot -by market. So even if they haven't institutionalized the price increases, just given the constraints, you are paying up for semiconductors. Again, that total number is about 195. It's a mix primarily semiconductor and resin. And as I made in my comments, we're obviously making progress on some of the offset initiatives that Kevin just talked about. But at this point, we're not -- [Indiscernible] are not ready to talk about how much of that we see rolling into 2022. Some of it will, and when the offset actions start to take effect."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Delaney Yes. . And  very much for taking the question. Bookings have been running very nicely year-to-date. The last couple of years, the fourth quarter in particular, has been quite strong. Maybe you can talk about how you see bookings tracking in the fourth quarter of this year."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark to predict. And it's incrementally difficult predicting in situations like we're in now where you're seeing supply chain disruptions. Several of the individuals from an OEM standpoint that are responsible for that activity are engaged to some extent in managing overall supply chain disruption. But I think with a fairly high level of confidence, we see bookings for the calendar year north of $20 billion, $21 billion, $22 billion so given what we see on the table today."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Delaney That's helpful. . And then for my follow-up question was related to the supply chain disruptions, but more around how the industry may try to better deal with these longer-term and a number of the OEM's are talking about procuring semiconductors and other key components more directly and not just working with Tier 1 like Aptiv. I know those discussions are ongoing, but we've been at this for a while now. I'm curious if you have an update, you can share it around how you think Aptiv's role in supply chain and working with your OEM partners may evolve? ."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark I -- that's a . I think, by and large, every participant in the supply chain is reevaluating their role and potentially what they can do differently. Having spoken now several times to the leaders of all the semiconductor companies, one of the critical items that needs to be addressed is committed volumes, right? When you look at an industry that is highly capital intensive, Predictability of production is extremely important and it gets compounded in an industry with long lead times that's currently constrained. So, however, we transition to more of a committed volume model, at least for the medium-term. Whether that's operating the way we historically operated with tiers being the primary face to the semiconductor players. Or it's OEMs working with the semiconductor players, as well as the tiers. Either can solve that problem. I think for us -- for Aptiv, we'll be flexible to operate in either scenario. I would say the one thing that will be different as we move forward is certainly more strategic relationships on the semiconductor side, which likely translates into deeper relationships, fewer semiconductor relationships that drive more volume in a more strategic relationship, both from a technology and a supply chain standpoint. . We're now moving on to Dan Levy from Credit Suisse with our next questio n. Please go ahead."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dan Levy Hey,  everyone . Wanted to just see if -- and I recognize you've given us some directional comments on '22. I appreciate it. I wanted to see if maybe we could put a slightly finer point on the directional comments. 1. You could just remind us on just pure volume growth alone, stripping  out the performance or other efficiencies or inefficiencies, what type of incremental margins you generally get, what you might expect in a year where there could be double-digit industry recovery? And then if commodity prices just stay flat versus where they are today, what's -- is there an early sense on what the net commodity impact is into 2022?"
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark Dan, if I can just chime in just to underscore the point Joe makes but maybe at a higher level. You take a step back and in 2018, global vehicle production was close to a 100 million units and this year, global vehicle production will be under 80. And in 2018, revenues were $14.4 billion, this year we'll do $15.3 and when you look at our guidance as it relates to full-year EBITDA [Indiscernible] and EBITDA margins. And you factor in the cost headwinds that Joe's walk through for 2021, be it supply chain or COVID and you look at the transition from where we were in '18 and where we are today in light of all these effectively macro challenges with incremental investment in advanced technologies. It just underscores the strength of the business model we've built in the fact that, \""hey, maybe quarters are short periods of time\"". We go through macro disruption, but the underlying robustness of the business model, the cash conversion is extremely strong, if not better than what it was historically."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dan Levy  and that's historical perspective certainly is helpful. . Second question, and I think it's a little -- a little more related, but it's specific to [Indiscernible] margin and I know there's a number of things that are moving up but it's been low, obviously, the volumes are quite weak and you have your Sunday cost inflation. I guess I'm wondering though just broadly on the go-forward. This is the segment where you have your software exposure. Theoretically, this is a segment where margin should sharply benefit as that software type revenue starts to come in on aid as you've obviously got app you'll get more. But you're talking about continued investment, it just feels like there could be more of a period of mid-single-digit or high single-digit type ASUX margins. And I guess I'm wondering, what are the things that need to happen for the margins to really break out in this segment? I know volume is a big one. But what else needs to happen?"
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark Yeah, listen. I think predictability of schedules is 1. 2. The execution on -- of the launch of the existing programs that we have that we're launching today is 2. The continued separation of software and hardware is three. And I guess the ongoing demand for the active safety, for the user experience, for the data and connectivity solutions that the segment provides. So, there's all sorts of tailwind there. Now having said that then, we've talked about some of the areas of opportunity in the future like SVA, like high performance compute areas, like software areas, where we feel like there's tremendous opportunity and if it makes sense, there are areas that we'll continue to invest in and some areas potentially increase investment in."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Murphy  for all the info and the shot at 20 -- what you've given us in '22, I know it's hard. Kevin, you mentioned one of the solutions to the issues that are going on right now is that automakers give more committed volumes and there's er visibility through the supply chain. I'm just  curious how you think that mechanically could work in an industry that is a slave to some degree to macroeconomic cycles, and you have [Indiscernible] volumes. It's just hard to understand how an automaker could sit there and give committed volume number because they are at the whim of what's happening in the macro, then also now finding out that they're at the whim of what could happen deep in the supply chain. I mean, how would you envision that committed volume from an automaker working?"
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark Listen, I think it's -- John, it's a  and it's not easy. So, you're -- the point you make is a legitimate point, but it's an issue everyone across the supply chain, right, has to deal with from the OEM, all the way through to the wafer manufacturers. So, it affects every aspect of the supply chain. And if there isn't some level of baseline commitment and some level of products for some period of time. There's an amount of estimating that everybody in the supply chain is doing, and ultimately, you end up in a situation like we find ourselves in today. So, I think on -- I think again -- I think we're from a supply chain standpoint, will be more strategic with customers and then through to Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 suppliers. The supply chain will be more integrated with more visibility. In exchange for that, they'll be more commitments at least on certain products for some agreed period of time. And that's the way the -- that's how we'll start to dig ourselves out of this for a more permanently address on some of the structural issues."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Murphy Okay. Sure, hope we get there. And it seems like you guys are in a good -- in a good spot to actually help manage up and manage down in some ways."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark Yeah. We're working at it. I mean, under Joe's leadership, from a supply chain standpoint, I'd say we're working more closely. We've always worked closely with our customers and our suppliers. I think we're working more closely than we ever have. There are going to be areas where we're likely to carry incremental inventory, but there's likely areas where we'll actually have to carry less. And we're just -- we're all getting smarter about it. And unfortunately, we had the COVID -induced perfect storm that we're going through in 2021. But I think everyone's focused on how do we learn from it and how do we improve how we operate."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Murphy And just a follow-up on vertical integration. I mean, we're hearing about this from these new EV manufacturers as well as the incumbents that are building up their own EV, essentially AV platforms. But ironically, there's a lot of stuff that they talk about that's very much sounds like set your satellite architecture or SVA, or other technologies that you bring to the table. So, when we hear -- when people hear vertical integration, they're like oh, crap, outsourcing is going to reverse and there's going to be in-sourcing, but it doesn't -- it seems like it's a question of semantics because it really sounds like a lot of your technology is leading in some of these platforms. So how should we generally think about it? Because it really seems like there is a semantics issue here about what vertical -- clinical vertical integration really is."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark Yeah -- no. Listen, you got a  point, and we do business with a number of the players that you'd refer to as new battery electric vehicle companies. And I think in reality, across all of them, there's very little in the areas of what they produce, that kind of vertical integrations religion. Vertical integration tends to be an economic trade-off. To your point, we feel like we're well-positioned with both software and hardware capabilities. We have architecture capabilities. I think we would tell you based on our discussion with all those players, the reality is there are certain areas that are growing rapidly in the car from a content standpoint, like software. And I think both in the software area and in the hardware area, OEM's whether the new OEM's or legacy OEM's, in reality are going to be dealing with fewer suppliers and a couple of the newer, the battery electric vehicle companies that we have relationships with, what they'll actually say, is more of the activity is actually outsourced from our standpoint today, but they are actually dealing with -- doing that with fewer suppliers. And that's, in our view, likely the trend that takes place and that's where we're working really hard to make sure that we're in front of that trend and we're able to benefit from it."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ittai Miceli . . , everybody. Just two quick ones, a near-term question and a longer-term question. On the near-term question, maybe Joe, could you just give us the puts and takes on the implied Q4 revenue GOM? And then maybe a longer-term question for Kevin. We heard recently with -- at the GM Investor Day their plans to launch consumer AV with the help of crews in about 5 years. I'm curious what Aptiv strategy is with respect to consumer AV, as well as your relationship with emotional and the potential fee, but to perhaps leverage that relationship in the next 5 or 10 years for our consumer AV."
4465453,Aptiv PLC,APTV,11/4/2021,CEO Kevin Clark on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Clark So, from a business standpoint, they're doing -- in technology advance standpoint, on the team, there's doing extremely well. A couple of comments broadly on AV is you know; we've always viewed autonomous driving as the furthest spectrum of full ADAS solutions. And we use our partnership with Motional as an opportunity to continue to test, to validate, to future proof technologies that we can pull into our current ADAS solutions. And that's what we continue to do. We feel like at Aptiv, this is Aptiv, there's a lot of opportunity that remains in the L0 to L3 sort of ADAS framework. 60% of -- less than 60% of vehicles today have an AF solution on them. If you believe IHS, they forecast that increases to 70% by 2025, we actually believe it will be more than that. And the fastest growing area will be on L2 and L2 plus. So, I would tell you that's our biggest focus area. Having said that -- and we're using motional as a resource to enhance the solutions that we use in the L2, L2 plus sort of space. And then concurrently we're working with Motional as well as have internal resources focused on L3 and beyond. Our view is that's -- that that's from a cost or commercial standpoint, that's likely beyond 2025, but it's certainly technology that we're focused on. And then it's a capability we want to make sure that we're positioned to have."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"A.J. Rice . Hello, everybody. Just maybe to try to drill down a little bit on that expectation for at least 10% growth of the new updated numbers for this year. I know it sounds like you're getting away from talking about that $250 of net COVID impact you're absorbing this year and others various inputs there, but I was wondering, because their last quarter it sounded like you were carrying a lot of your expectation for COVID related costs broadly defined into next year. As you think about your updated thoughts about '22, can you comment on how much of ongoing COVID headwind are you expecting and is there any other big changes to the puts and takes you'd laid out last quarter as you think about '22?"
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Cordani Hey A.J., . It's David. Let me try to shape our insights relative to 2022, now that we're much deeper into 2021. First, you're right earlier this year, we've tried to frame the magnitude of the headwind and indisputably COVID had many disruptions to the marketplace, whether it's testing, treatment, revenue, dislocation, etc. Against that backdrop, as you know, our broad service portfolio and a broad funding mechanism continued to perform quite well, and we're able to deliver from a marketplace standpoint. If you think about 2021, there's really four big chunky items. One was up pulling the headwind category. The headwind created by the COVID cost and the headwind created by MRA revenue decrement. And then, positives offsetting that somewhat which were favorable net investment income and some operating expense items. Now as we think about and look at the 2022 environment, our visibility in terms of our growth outlook, our rate execution, our affordability initiatives, our efficiency initiatives, and our understanding of how this year is coming to close, broadly speaking, those puts and take in 2021 largely offset one another as we step into 2022, the headwinds and tailwinds. Our at least 10% growth in 2022 off of our elevated 2021 EPS, essentially represents capital deployment in line with our strategic target of 4% to 5% of accretion. And the residual at least 5% to 6% from fundamental operating growth to get us to that at least 10%. To recap, additional visibility in terms of the drivers for 2022 growth -- mix of growth, rate execution affordability. And then secondly, the puts-and-takes in 2021 are configuring in a way that they've largely offset one and other as we step into 2022, underscoring that at least 10% is largely fundamental for our business portfolio."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Lisa Gill  very much, and . David, I just wanted to better understand how you're thinking about the Ever-north business as we think about 2022? I know you've talked in the past about some of the business losses, but if you can give us an update as to how to think about Ever north going into 2022, and then as we think about the Ever-north business and think about the virtual primary care offerings that are out in the marketplace, what are you thinking with MDLIVE?"
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Cordani , Lisa. So relative to Ever north, first as we step into 2022, as Brian and I both noted, we're quite pleased with the underlying performance of Ever north. If you look at the inherent growth that ever north has delivered for the organization, and the diversity of the growth, we're quite pleased with that. Secondly, our ability to both drive fundamental growth because you'd invest in innovation and extend our partnerships, we feel quite good. So just framing Ever north and then coming to the MDLIVE question, our Ever north portfolio has 4 specific portfolios of services that are positioned well: Evernorth pharmacy, Evernorth care, Evernorth Benefits, and Evernorth intelligence. Our positioning growth at the serving health plans, large employers, expanding with governmental age ncies, and increasingly with healthcare providers continues to resonate well in the marketplace. For 2022, to your comment relative to some losses, we expect to retention rate in the Evernorth pharmacy business in the mid-90s, which is still a strong result even with the known losses we'd identified. And given the strength we've had of growth over the last several years, we're quite committed to maintaining price discipline in the marketplace, so the business portfolio will grow yet again. Specific to MDLIVE, we're delighted to have the MDLIVE capabilities in our portfolio and that now resides within Evernorth care. We see the utilization of those services continue to grow. As I noted, beyond important, urgent or Triage care. But two primary behavioral dermatology. And then we've recently expanded our virtual-first offering. So, we see it as a  opportunity to both expand access, improve affordability. But finally, it presents a platform to broaden some access to care in terms of alternative side of care capabilities. So, in a nutshell, we're pleased, we'll grow again and we're investing in further growth, including within the virtual capabilities of MDLIVE."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Justin Lake . . I wanted  to ask David about the international sale. First, in terms of multiple, it looks like you've got about 10 to 12 times kind of net income for that business. Is that correct? In the right ballpark? And then if so, just curious in terms of the strategic nature of the sale in terms of -- the multiple looks depressed relative to a business that's historically been looked at as a double-digit top-line grower. And then could you tell us how we should think about capital deployment once you get those funds? Is it going to be similar to what we saw with the Life and Disability, where there's a lot of share repo or should we think about something else? ."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Hall Hey guys, this is Michael Hall on for Ricky. . So, as it relates to 2022 commercial growth, a number of your peers have already mentioned expecting strong growth. They diffuse concerns around member attrition, and the dynamic, and emphasize share gains, I think one of your peers even mentioned '22 shaping up to be one of the strongest national account selling seasons in history. So, with that said, it's been a bright area, but also hard to imagine that everyone is winning contracts and gaining share. So, with that context, what are you guys seeing with the competitive landscape? And are you able to grow next year when everyone else comes in taking share?"
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin Fischbeck . . It sounds like in the quarter you mentioned, you've benefited from investment income and specialty outperformance. I guess, two things. So, do you believe that the specialty outperformance is something that is going to be sustainable? And then if you could just talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape for commercial pricing for next year, do you think that you're going to be within your target range? Or I guess maybe where your t arget range is expected to be in the commercial business for next year."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gary Taylor Hi, . Just wanted to go back to the MCR comments and appreciate what you just said, David, but just wanted to think a little bit more about 2021 so far. So, as we kind of look at the potential impact of special enrollment period enrollees based on your typical attrition. It doesn't look like that's particularly material to the increase in MCR versus 2019 baseline, which is up about 400 basis points in the 3Q when you had a lot of COVID costs, but it was up almost 400 basis points in the 2Q when you didn't have a lot of COVID costs and you had more deferred care coming back. So, I guess the question is, is there any other substantial moving parts to how you're running versus the 2019 baseline, and then just going forward, what are your -- what do you anticipate as COVID and the Delta variant comes down? Do you feel like commercial utilization is largely caught up or we're sort of still back in a cycle, like you were in the 2Q where you see some of the deferred care increasing?"
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Evanko Morning, Gary. It's Brian. So, I'll try to take the various components of that question here. So, as you think about where we are running in 2021 on the MCR, maybe I'll talk in terms of the full-year guide. I think that that's probably the most constructive way to pull it apart. the 84% to 84.5% refresh guidance that we issued. If the special enrollment period lives within the individual exchange portfolio had not grown to the level that they are, and had not had the elevated MCR that they did in the quarter, we would've had an MCR performance for the full-year that was more like the higher end of our prior guidance range, so towards the higher end of the 83% to 84% range, if you exclude the impact of the Individual SCP customers from the full-year outlook. So just to give you a little bit of dimensioning as to the materiality  there. Those customer lives have built up over the course of the year, so there were not that many in the second quarter, there were many more in the third quarter. And the elevated MCR hit us, particularly, significantly in the third quarter and we expect that pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. As David did reference to in a prior question, we would expect that to dissipate into 2022 as many of those lives attrit into our choose new carriers. As it relates to other parts of the portfolio. The commercial business in the third quarter, we had some elevated COVID related costs, particularly in August and September, with the Delta variant hitting younger ages more significantly than earlier in the pandemic. So that created some elevated commercial claim cost pressure in the third quarter. I would note in our Medicare Advantage book, the MCR in the quarter was a little bit favorable to our expectations, which gives us er confidence here as we head into 2022 on that subset of the overall U.S. Medical book of business. Hopefully it gives you a little bit of a picture for how 2021 is shaping up. In terms of your question, looking forward on commercial utilization, are we caught up, etc. we have seen much less deferred care in the commercial line of business throughout the pandemic, and all the indicators that we track, whether that be preventive care utilization or whether that be rates of new cancer diagnoses, etc. I would tell you that there's not a significant amount of future pent-up demand or catch-up care to come. With that said, our pricing posture, as David mentioned earlier continues to be a prioritization of margin expansion as we head into 2022."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ralph Giacobbe . . I guess I want to go back -- you guys specifically called out the increased specialty contributions, and obviously that's always been part of the story. So hoping you can give more details there, what the specific drivers are there, and anything to call out. And then maybe within that, I was hoping you could talk about the stop loss product. I would have imagined that just given higher commercial trend that maybe more of that is being triggered and maybe some underperformance there. But we just like to get your commentary on how that's performed and how we should think about that for 2022 from a re-pricing perspective. ."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Evanko Sure, David. , Ralph. So in terms of the specialty contributions we called out they're the couple of areas I'd particularly point to as more material within our self-funded business, we had some strength in pharmacy in particular, and as I mentioned earlier, to a prior question, we would expect that to persist as we head into 2022. We also saw some upside within our behavioral health offerings as demand for that has continued to grow throughout the pandemic. So we saw some increased uptake there, which drove some additional margin for us within the quarter. And again, those are two areas we would expect to persist as we head into the new year. Relative to stop loss, obviously you gotta pull this one apart further because you got Individual stop loss cover as well as aggregate stop loss cover, and the dynamics there behaved a little bit differently throughout the pandemic, meaning most COVID related claimants didn't actually hit our Individual stop-loss thresholds. Yet we saw a little bit of pressure earlier in the pandemic on our aggregate stop loss business. That business gets repriced along with our typical 12-month contract cycles for all the clients that we have. So we feel good about how we positioned there on a prospective basis. I'd also note we're seeing good demand for that product. You probably saw on the supplement there, we had 7% premium growth on our stop loss line in the quarter-over-quarter. So, feeling good about all the specialty solutions when you look at the total portfolio."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Josh Raskin Hi, . . Appreciate you guys taking the question. So the MLR, I know you guys, only disclose one sort of big MLR for the U.S. Medical segments. I was wondering if you could break out or give a little bit more color even if it just directional on the MLR 's for sort of commercial and then, government and maybe, even within government, how much was from the IFP versus Medicare Advantage? And then just a quick follow-up on stop-loss, what are the attachment points at the individual claim level typically? I know there's a range of those, but kind of maybe what's the most common thresholds than an individual has to hit?"
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Evanko , Josh. So I'll try not to be too redundant with s ome of my prior comments, but just to kind of summarize a few important points here as you pull apart the MLR for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, the refresh 84% to 84.5% outlook reflects particular pressure from the Individual exchange lives and specifically the special enrollment period enrollees. So removing that, we would have been toward the higher end of our prior guide of 83% to 84%, but a sub bullet there is the individual open enrollment lives are actually performing pretty well. So when we look at the profitability of the overall individual portfolio, we have good performance on the standard open enrollment lives. We have poor performance on the special enrollment period lives and the total picture there is therefore a bit elevated. Medicare Advantage as I made reference to actually ran a little bit favorable to our expectations in the third quarter. And then commercial was a touch higher than our projections due to the effect of the Delta variant in the months of August and September in particular. So those are the broad buckets that I paint for you, do you think about what's inside the medical care ratio. Relative to stop loss, we do have a range of attachment points depending on the client. So we tend to see particular popularity around the $15,000 to $75,000 level, but it really depends on the risk appetite for a given client. So it's hard to say that there's one that's always the preferred choice. We have a distribution and the distribution evolves depending on the appetite for clients at any given point in time."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"James Stewart Hi, this is James Stewart on for Kevin. Just maybe with the sale of Chubb, you're signaling more of a focus to core healthcare business. Are there any other segments within the Company that you consider a non-core that you might be looking to dispose off in the future?"
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Valiquette . , everybody. Just a question that maybe tie as a lot of the other discussion points together. For the preliminary view of '22, I know it's early, but just thinking about the framework of '22 relative to some of your long-term targets that you laid out the analyst meeting. I'm curious -- so for U.S. Medical, you just talked about growth next year, but the long-term guidance range is 8% to 11% earnings growth in that segment, 4% to 6% for Evernorth, and the rest from capital deployment. But should we think about -- is that still the usable framework going into '22, or should we think about maybe less operational growth, and maybe more from capital deployment. Just any additional thoughts around those components might help knowing that its preliminary right now."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Cordani Sure. , it's David. Big picture as you look to 2022, brief reference to this previously, but our view of the earnings visibility and the growth visibility relative to 2022 essentially, if you take the -- at least 10%, we underscore that with capital contribution to our EPS growth in line with our strategic target, which is 4 to 5. Then if you back away from that, that leaves you 5 to 6 fundamental organic earnings growth contribution to get to the at least 10% number. And we think that's an appropriate and prudent and attractive outlook given the fluidity and dynamism of the marketplace. Broadly speaking, both components are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and we have a track record including 2021, which is a disrupted year of delivering in line with that. Good fundamentals, a little more than 50% of it being organic, a little less than 50% of it being capital deployment, and very much in line with our long-term strategic targets."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Borsch Yes. . Just wanted to ask what you're seeing in terms of customer preferences and actions in the middle market, particular degree of interest in alternate ASO type funding for the products versus what you've seen over the last few years. And then maybe in the stop loss market associated with that. Am I correct that some of the other carriers may be correcting for what was perhaps overly aggressive pricing in earlier years, which is maybe giving you a little bit of a tailwind there on your own growth?"
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Cordani Matthew, , It's David. So you referenced middle market. I don't think there's a singular common definition middle markets, so let me try to frame your important comment. First, as you look at our go-to market offerings, we have a broad suite of funding alternatives and we seek to offer to our clients their respective decision of how they want to finance the purchase after the benefits are configured, after the access profile is configured, after the clinical programs are configured, and the service mod els are configured to align as Brian referenced before, the risk transfer in the balance relative to them, so having that broad suite is really important. If we look at the select segment, 100 to 500 live clients, it varies from year-to-year in terms of how much of the client demand is guaranteed cost versus self-funded with stop-loss, but self-funded with stop-loss has been a meaningful portion. And as you walk from that into the heart of what I might consider middle-market, the further you walk up an average size, on average, more demand for self-funded, less demand for risk transfer. And in the in between range, some for shared returns of a fundamentals that exist. So a little bit of linearity as you just go off in respect to size from that standpoint, but the important part is choice that we offer in the marketplace and try to separate the financing decisions. from the design features from the program. I would say to the last part of your question, I do not believe that there's a boomerang or reconfiguration effect that happened that we've benefited from a stop-loss standpoint. We've seen just consistency in how we use stop loss. And I'm remind ed from prior conversations, we have a large book, we have a dedicated team that manages that book because it needs to be specialization in that like many other aspects of our business. And it's both performed for clients, importantly, giving them the peace of mind and revenue predictability and expense predictability they need, as well as for us over a long period of time. But I would not call out anything unique in terms of ebbing and flowing that's changed our rate of growth in stop loss over the recent past."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"George Hill , guys, and s. David and Brian, just a couple of being counting ones and a quick question. David, I just want to make sure that 2035 or whatever the number is post Q4 is the right jumping off point for the 10% or better growth in 2022, given it sounds like you're saying all the other pushes and pulls are on mute now, can you quantify PBM to commercial medical cross-sales this selling season? And I'll pause right there."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Cordani So George Hill it's two questions I heard. Question 1, yes. The at least $20.35, which is our raised EPS is the appropriate jump off to attach the at least 10% growth. We're pleased to have that underlying strength in that clarity of message. The second question, I think you're asking relative to PBM, commercial cross-sell penetration, etc. In respective growth, I don't have an Individual number for you. We have not historically walk-through individual numbers there. I'd ask you to step back and remember our strategy here. We have a high cross-sell and high integrated offering within our medical business. As you think within the prior question that Matthew asked, as you go to our select segment, think about that as 100% integrated. It is so integral to our offering, and as you move upmarket, it's more of a standalone sale that needs to be made. We see continued progress there, and we're pleased to either have it as an integrated part of our medical offering or a standalone PBM offering that we could harness and sell additional services because at the end of the day, as I called up my prepared remarks, there were 2 fundamental ways in which a client or customer establishes their primary health and wellbeing relationship. Either a pharmacy relationship or largely off of a medical relationship. and we're positioned to lever both. So I would leave you with a directional answer on the PBM commercial. Brian referenced PBM strength over pharmacy strength in our commercial portfolio. That's a net positive. And we continue to see on traction both on standalone pharmacy as well as integrated pharmacy within our business."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Baxter Hi, . Just wanted to come back to the individual market commentary you made. Appreciate that you're pricing, I guess conservatively in a fairly competitive backdrop. How much of the way back towards your target margins do you think that's going to get you in 2022? And then how should we think about growth beyond 2022 as you previously have talked about, doubling this market through 2025? ."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Windley Hi,  for taking my questions. David, I'm interested in your views, albeit early, on this Build Back Better bill that appears to be moving toward a vote, and maybe specifically, what you think the impact of government negotiation on a top 10 or 20 drugs beyond our exclusivity would have on your PBM business?"
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Cordani , Dave. So clearly a lot of fluidity right now on the health and we've operated for a long period of time in an environment and we'll continue to that has an active both legislative and regulatory agenda. So we understand that fully. Big picture stepping back, any initiatives that are constructive and sustainable, that improve affordability and value for individuals, we're actively open to engaged in and generally supportive of. Specifically in the pharmacy space where you double-click down on. We think the most meaningful way to test sustainable policies -- policy change that could further affordability is to stimulate and further accelerate more competition. And if a heart come back as an example to make it tangible, hepatitis C was, I think, a very positive example that reinforces that. But as the marketplace rapidly move from 1 to 2 suppliers for hepatitis C servic es, which was a breakthrough drug that society benefits from, the overall affordability changed dramatically. That's an action that is different than who's negotiating or it's very different than putting in artificial cap on a rate of growth from that standpoint. Big picture, we will await specific details and we will remain actively engaged, no doubt. We believe the most sustainable way to further improve affordability, is to expand choice and expand competition. That's what's worked in the marketplace in the model. And lastly, per prior conversation we've had our well-performing and broad portfolio pharmacy services and tools is well-positioned to be able to deliver value in a changing environment, and we're confident in the capabilities we have over the strategic horizon here."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Lance Wilkes Could you just give a little more color on Evernorth pharmacy and what I was particularly interested in is, from a vaccine standpoint in the quarter, how much of that impact volumes and margin? And then are you seeing much impact to margin from specialty pharmacy going generic, whether that's the beginning or your outlook for that? ."
4465467,Cigna Corporation,CI,11/4/2021,CEO David Cordani on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Evanko , Lance. It's Brian. So within the third quarter in Evernorth, we fulfilled about 4 million COVID vaccine prescriptions. So to put that into context, that's about 1% of our total script volume, and year-to-date, we're up to about 16 million across the three quarters here in 2021. So again, roughly about 1% of total script volumes for Evernorth, but not a material contribution from an income standpoint. And if that number goes up or down next year, it won't materially move the needle for the Evernorth segment. More broadly on the second part of your question, as we think about specialty generics, and you can even broaden that to include biosimilars. We're really excited about those for the future from the standpoint of driving affordability on behalf of our clients and customers. We think competition is a good thing and ultimately, Specialty Generics. While the timing with which they're introduced is hard to predict and does create some variability in our quarterly income patterns. Ultimately, we view that as a  thing for our clients, customers, and ultimately for our business. And fortunately, we have a wide range of earnings levers that allow us to capture value in a variety of ways depending on how different client contracts are constructed. We're really excited about especially generics and biosimilars going forward."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unidentified Analyst Hi. .  for taking my questions. Just wanted to start  with the equity units change here. We look to offset any of the $0.09 impacts to '22 or '23, and just thinking about the incremental positives after the Analyst Day this year, such as the higher renewable signings and the Redondo extension. How do you see all of that shaking out with the latest change here?"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Coughlin Sure, no -- , Andres. And . As I said in my script, this is recalculation, so it's just a different denominator on the capital, on the equity units that we raised earlier this year. It's purely just math, frankly. And looking ahead, we do see we have many levers, as Andres said. so we're fully committed to the 7% to 9%. These shares were already incorporated as of 2024, so it has no impact on that longer-term growth rate. And then, looking ahead, we have a number of value accretive opportunities in the portfolio. So we're in the midst of our planning process at this point and we'll give 2022 guidance in February. But we feel very confident in the overall growth rate and there's definitely things that we can do to stay within -- stay within that range going forward."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unidentified Analyst Understood.  for the color there. And then maybe just switching gears to the C&I side of the progress shown with the Microsoft deal. Curious if you could speak a little bit to the 2 gigawatts you cited at similarly structured solutions signed year-to-date, how that compares to initial expectations. And then just broadly, any near term limitations to your ability to further rollout this around the clock product to just how you think about scalability there overall. ."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andres Gluski Sure. I think we're rolling it out very well. We have said, from the beginning when we did the first Google one, that this was a product that was -- there was a lot of interest from other large corporate customers. We feel good that this is not the last deal we'll do. I think, the key here is the ability to provide around the clock, and so this is 100% renewable for 15 years. So the product keeps getting more sophisticate. Now, to do that, you need to be able to model all possible situations in a given area of service, integrating also batteries and different forms of renewable power. So we've been very flexible on that. We're very excited about that, and we see additional opportunities going forward. I think as we mentioned, 90% of the deals we have signed, in the last year-to-date, have been with corporate customers. And so we really see this type of structured project -- product really being a competitive advantage for us. So stay tuned. We think there's a -- something that we've been talking about. We're really seeing it come to fruition."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Hey, , Andres and Steve. Welcome and I look forward to working with you. A couple of questions from my end. First, just, Andres you made that comment, that majority of the backlog to 2024 is now secured. Can I just ask you to clarify when you say that, that means wind, solar, storage, everything?"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andres Gluski No, we were basically talking about solar panels, but we also have the balance of plan. So we feel very secured about it. But the one that's been, let's say, more in the press and more top of mind for everybody, has been solar panels. We very early on, started switching buying from Chinese panels to buying panels made in Malaysia, Vietnam, and in the future, Cambodia. And we've also, I think, been leaders in getting our suppliers to certify that there's no, let's say, poly silicon coming from Western China in the -- that could be questionable in terms of the labor practices. So we feel very comfortable. We have the supplies. We have flexibility. And we're also buying a number of U.S. panels made in the U.S. so -- without polysilicone by the by the way. So altogether we feel very comfortable that we have enough to meet our backlog to 2024, and that includes the balance of the plant, and that includes a batteries."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Got it. I mean, I guess in the last quarter, Andres, you'd mentioned something around maybe 90% of the equipment needed for your then-stated backlog of like, I think it was 8.5 gigawatts. Are you in that similar percentage wise for this updated 9.2 gigawatt number?"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Peters Back to the different accounting treatment for the equity units, you guys made the point to mention that it was consistent with other peers and the auditors had signed off. I'm wondering what specifically changed that you are now subject to this new interpretation?"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Coughlin Yes. This is Steve. I'm happy to describe it in a little more detail. We issued the $1 billion equity units back in March. And as I said, it was -- the treatment that we use was very well vetted by our accountants, by our external auditors, and to external advisors. at that point, we were using a treasury stock method for the treatment, so it didn't show up in the shared account. So there's a number of companies that have used similar instruments, and in consultation with our auditors, SEC had done a review of the treatment of these types of instruments, and has informed our auditors that they see a different interpretation. So, although we haven't had direct communications with the SEC, we felt it was most prudent that we go ahead and update the interpretation. So we're really just taking the prudent course of action here. This conversion was already assumed in the 2024 share count, so it's just an interim impact to the calculation. There's no new transaction here. It's just this recalculation of the shares. Ultimately, that's the source of it and we're trying to be as prudent as we can in terms of the treatment."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Peters . I appreciate the detail there. Another question I had, switching gears, and appreciate the slide in the deck that you -- showing the value you've created through Fluence and Uplight, and, I guess, now that Fluence is public, would be a little bit more curious to hear about Uplight in terms of how you think about the value of that Company today versus when you got the value mark and going forward? Particularly because, I think, I just saw that Uplight completed an acquisition recently?"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andres Gluski . Look, we see Uplight,in the terms of its maturity, two to three years behind Fluence. But we're very happy with the progress that up Uplight has made and very happy with what we've done with AES Next. Because, if you look at our capital contribution and today's valuation, that's a 20-X. So that's -- some of this has been in -- even though we were working for example, on batteries for a long time, but really in terms of having a business, it's been roughly about three years -- 3, 4 years. This has created a lot a lot of value for our shareholders. And it's very interesting because there's two sides of the business. The AES Next is really a value play, especially during this rapid growth phase because you have to expense a lot of your investments really. But at the same time, they are helping us grow. When you talk about the structured products that we're selling to corporations, having AES Next and the know-how from there, has been extremely helpful. As I said, stay tuned, we have others in the works. The most mature probably is 5B. We think 5B has a lot of potential because of what it offers. It offers speed of build, it offers less use of land, and hurricane resistant is very important. Hurricane wind resistant is very important. So we're very happy with the progress there and very happy about the relationship between the AES core business and AES Next."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Peters . And then just last one quickly, just a point of clarification. You said AES Next was roughly at the $0.06 drag today. But as we get out into the outer years of your plan, I guess '24 and '25, are you expecting it to be contributing at that point or would it still be a drag?"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Coughlin Yeah. No. No, we are. So I mean, I think there's a near-term dilution around of a similar level, say for 2022 and then that gradually reduces. And so by 2024, '25, we're expecting positive contributions and then significant acceleration in the positive contribution from that point."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin Smith Hey,  team. Congratulations on everything. Well done. To come back to this AES Next -- again, kudos there. As you guys think about the drag here, you talked about '21 having $0.06 drag. Through  the '25 period here, how are you thinking about the cadence of that drag to evolve here? By the timing of '25, what is that reflected in your expectations here? And then, maybe, I'll throw in another nuanced EPS questions. When you're -- when you're thinking about the converts here, obviously you were able to offset that and be at the top end of '21. What does that say about by the time you get to 25, considering that the converts admittedly would've been sort of effectively fully diluted by then in terms of where you stand within your range as well. Again, give us a backdrop of all your successes, be it origination or otherwise."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Coughlin Obviously, as Andres said, I lead Fluence for its first 2.5 years, so I'm very familiar with the Company and its trajectory. And look the opportunity for Fluence has gotten massive, more massive than even we predicted when I started there. Going out and raising this capital was clearly targeted to go big and go much bigger. And so this, in some ways, what it does is it increases the near-term dilution deliberately because we're investing to accelerate the scale of the Company. And we know that it can be successful if we accelerate. But it's also then significantly increasing the upside when you get out into 24-25 period. Putting this capital to work is going to be near-term dilutive, but it's tremendously value accretive. And we've already seen some recognition of that in where it is today. And we think it's only going to go significantly upward from here. In our numbers, it turns positive, and it turns significantly positive by 2025."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin Smith And that significantly positive, is reflected in that 25 number today? Want to understand how much of the earnings [Indiscernible]"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Coughlin Yeah. Yeah. It is reflected, and I would say, it comes -- from the level of dilution today, it's going to flip flop to being at least that level positive by that point."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin Smith And we say at least that level positive that is AES Next in entirety, right? Not just look."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Coughlin Yeah, I think Fluence will be at that point. Uplight will have grown too, but I would expect Fluence would likely be a few ahead be the largest driver, but I would say at least $0.06 positive from Next, by 2025."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin Smith Right. Okay. Got it. Excellent.  for the clarity there. And then if I can just -- more strategic question here also against your backdrop of 25 numbers. California extension, you've only reflected this new numbers through -- you haven't reflected this through 2025. That seems like a further upside whether it's Redondo or the entirety of the Legacy portfolio. And then ultimately you -- just when you think about the portfolio all together at this possible transition, again, kudos on transition, how are you thinking about some of the lingering assets and especially some of the renewed interest across the marketplace city for instance LNG?"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andres Gluski Julien, regarding the LNG. We have a very strong position in the Gulf of Mexico, between the Dominican Republic and Panama. We have basically been contracting much more in terms of the Dominican Republic filling up the second tank, and the Panama filling up the first tank. So we see LNG as a necessary transition fuel. And I think what we're seeing a little bit in Europe and a little bit in China. It's very important to manage this transition. So while we were coming up with new technologies, making it possible to put more renewables on the grid, make renewable cheaper, make them more efficient and satisfy more what customers want. We see that in some -- many places, LNG natural gas is the necessary transition fuel. These two will work together. And as we said, we are on our way to filling up our full capacity of the two locations of the three tanks."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin Smith Got it. So it sounds like literally and perhaps figuratively, you haven't quite filled the tank on the incremental contribution from LNG or California when it comes to '25 yet, but there's more go."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andres Gluski Yes. That's right. That's right. There's still more potential. Quite frankly, that's the most profitable thing we can do, is to fill up an existing tank."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Julien Dumoulin Smith Yeah. Actually guys. . Best of luck.
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Stephen Byrd  very much and congrats on a very constructive update here.
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd Yes, Sir. I wanted to explore the Google Nest agreement and talk a little bit more about the magnitude if you could, and repeatability of that approach? it looks like a  solution where you can bring a lot of your skills to bear, to provide some value, but I'm struggling thinking about how to try to assess the magnitude of the opportunity here."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andres Gluski Well, this is through Uplight. And Uplight has been -- I believe the biggest seller of Nest in the U.S. because it reaches around 100 million final consumers in the U.S. So the idea is to continue to add on that platform more things, and improve customers experience, and customers capabilities of improving their energy efficiency use. Now, of course, Uplight works through large utilities. That's really how it goes. I think, there is a lot of opportunity there. I agree with that. And what Uplight has been doing is acquiring additional capabilities by some of these acquisitions, adding onto that platform. It's really using that platform, using that entry, into final consumers to provide additional value-add services."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd Understood. And is there a way to think about that value in terms of the per customer value, or some other metric, in terms of the benefit that utilities would receive from the kinds of services you provide here?"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andres Gluski I don't have that available right now. I think the way to think about it, is this is the value of the total Uplight platform. And as you know, we partnered with Schneider Electric to have more capabilities, with more acquisitions. and we're working very closely with our utility customers. So I think the way this value will be reflected and captured, is through the value of Uplight. And as I said, I think it's 2-3 years behind Fluence in terms of its evolution."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd Okay. Very clear. And then just last question for me, just on LNG. You've been making  progress, you just described on Julien 's question, you're moving towards filling up a number of these resources. I was thinking once they're essentially filled to the capacity that you've targeted, they're fairly mature assets at that point and there might be a more logical owner with a fairly low discount rate at that point once they're mature. Are these good monetization assets when they're mature? The reasons you kind of see further option value essentially around these assets longer-term?"
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andres Gluski I think, 2 things: As you know, we are growing very rapidly in renewables. We have plans to sell down coal. So we will continue to manage this portfolio to optimize its value for our shareholders, and we'll see how that develops. Right now, our focus is really on filling up the gas tanks."
4465483,The AES Corporation,AES,11/4/2021,CEO Andres Gluski on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andres Gluski , Steve. [Operator Instructions] We currently have no further questions. I would like to hand over to Ahmed Pasha for any final remarks. .  everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Next week, we look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Conference.  again. And have a nice day. This concludes today's call.  so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines and have a  rest of your day."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tien-Tsin Huang . And  to all of you guys. This is having been busy going through all this data. So  so much for sharing it. It's really, really useful. I'll start with that and I had a bigger picture question for Gary, if you don't mind as my follow-up. Just on the merchant volume and transaction data you've given us a lot of good stuff here. The lines clearly show you're tracking very well with the network data. But I guess the revenue side, you do derive revenue both from volume and transactions. So if we wanted to benchmark revenue against some of those metrics, how would you guide us there and I think ultimately we all want to get a better sense of pricing like-for-like and how that's evolving because mix clearly plays a role? ."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall Yeah, it certainly plays a role Tien-Tsin. We tried to outline both volume growth and transaction growth within the detail materials  in the press release. I think we also gave growth back to 2019, as many of us have been trying to effectively forget 2020, in some levels and ways. We have seen volume growth compared to 2019, attract very closely to the networks. We've also seen transaction growth slow a little bit, in terms of its growth rate. Ultimately providing us incremental yield on that volume, which is what we expected and where we expect it to continue to track. And if you look at 2000 -- QQ 2019 growth of revenue versus the global volume compared to the third quarter, we had about 9 points of incremental yield benefit. And that really takes out kind of the noise between both 2020, and the move shift of the tax movement. So that's the one we've been very focused on. But we tried to be extremely transparent today to give you every piece of data that we look at and thinking about our revenue growth trajectory."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tien-Tsin Huang  for that. We'll definitely be studying it. As my follow-up you don't mind just bigger picture for you, Gary, I'd really on your superuser comment because I thought that was really interesting. A lot of things to think about there, but I'll summarize that, I guess. Does this mean you envision FIS servicing larger, diversified clients that, I would imagine have some buying power, but are you also suggesting that there's a shift from maybe point solutions or best-of-breed consumption versus bundled buying? Just trying to think about all of this because you have different peers and of course you have a lot of scale across all these different businesses. But what's division here longer-term?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Gary Norcross platforms that are available. We then leaned in with next-generation application stacks, and we've talked a lot about that through componentization, whether it's modern banking platform, whether its payments one, whether it's digital one, whether it's nap, the list goes on and on. So now the next phase is how do you bring that together and weave that together to a one-stop place for innovators, large conglomerates, anybody looking to take advantage of various capabilities in the open market. And we see it as a huge opportunity. We highlighted just a very small subset. of clients already leveraging our next-generation capabilities across all 3 segments, you're going to see that grow very dramatically over the next 3 years. You will also continue to see our level of technology debt get displaced as our existing clients migrate to this framework as well. So we're real excited about the future. We highlighted another 2 wins on modern banking platform today. One of those wins was the first customer that has signed up for an existing core banking system of FIS to start transitioning to NBP. So as we've talked a lot, we're really at the forefront of this transformation and this is just the next step in FIS' journey and we'll continue. And why we're so confident in our long-term guide are up 79% in mid-teens EPS, and you'll continue to see that resonate in the coming years."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jason Kupferberg On margins, and I know you're targeting 50 to 100 basis points a year on average of expansion, there. Certainly, we understand there is natural economies of scale in the business, but, just wanted to make sure, do you feel this type of margin expansion still gives you enough flexibility to invest in the business to the extent that it's contemplated by the updated capital allocation strategy, just given the dynamics in your various end markets are obviously changing faster than ever. And maybe just as an extension to that, just what's your current thought process around where consensus sets for 2022? I think it's exactly in line with your multiyear guide but just wanted to see how you're feeling about that?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall Yeah with regard to the 50 to a  100 basis points of margin expansion, we do think that's sustainable through our mid-term outlook as we've talked about numerous times, there's tremendous operating leverage within the business as we continue to drive automation and drive efficiencies through normal operations of the business. Incremental revenues have high contribution margins that help with that margin expansion as well. With regard to the investment side of it, we've baked in our expectations of investment into that 50 to a 100 basis points of margin expansion. So we feel good about our ability to continue to invest, to drive, and sustain that accelerated growth profile that we've built out. So in addition, those are the two comments I really would think about margin. If you think about 2022, we're not updating our formal '22 to guide until February. That said, we're not changing anything in terms of our mid-term outlook around 2022, of 7% to 9% revenue growth and 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion. So continuing to keep that as a longer-term outlook consistent with what we've been saying for a number of quarters."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jason Kupferberg Understood. And just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on M&A, it sounds like a little bit more emphasis there as part of the updated capital allocation strategy. I know Stephanie's spending a lot of time In that area, can you help us understand just where are you in terms of M&A pipeline bill that certainly sounds like the [indiscernible] there will be towards some higher growth assets . And could you be considering deals that might be dilutive initially?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall We're very focused on completing each integration before we move to the next. So we feel good about where we're at on that integration. Secondly, on your accretion dilution comment around whether we would do something that's dilutive. We don't look at accretion dilution as the only value metric. In fact, we think it's probably just one of many value creation long-term is much more and how we think about M&A whether it's enhancing our growth profile or filling out gaps strategically into our product portfolio that we can push through our distribution channel. So yes, we would think about something potentially dilutive from an accretion dilution analysis. But never that doesn't drive incremental value to shareholders, long term."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Darrin Peller , guys.  for all the disclosure on the merchant side. For this though, I really want to focus on the banking and the Capital Market side for a minute, just given, obviously it's still majority of your revenues, and very strong growth with 8% on the banking side, 10% organic uncapped markets. I know there were some items pulled forward. But can you just touch on especially the pipeline on the banking side when you think about how well modern banking platform has been doing, and the demand we're hearing about from just the end markets in financial services for tech in general. What growth do you see that potentially being able to generate over the next several years when you see that kind of demand on the banking and the products you offer? And then maybe just quickly touch on the strength in CAP markets for a minute?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall I'd just add on to Gary a little bit here. I think -- again, we started this several years ago. We really had a strategy around how we we're going to accelerate growth in those verticals, obviously before WorldPay became part of the organization. And even to the question earlier, we've focused on, how do we cross-sell? We had this big, broad set of assets that we wanted to be able to cross-sell into our client bases and our teams have really rallied around that. They've done an excellent job of building out the products that's, building out how people consume them and put us in a very good position. As Gary mentioned, our pipeline has been excellent, our sales execution is better all-time high. Yet again, after our all-time high last year, Capital Market's same thing, a lot of [Indiscernible] Probably the other comment I would add is, as we've gone through these projects over the last several years, while our capital was originally on data [indiscernible] consolidation and some of those things, as we've come to a close of those, we're taking that capital and redeploying it in new products and accelerating our new products to meet the challenges of our customers. And we stand today  very excited about the opportunities to continue to grow, to continue to cross-sell. We see lots of TAM expansion as we're moving into these markets. So we feel very comfortable that we can continue to grow this business and a very healthy [Indiscernible]"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Darrin Peller Okay. That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up, when you look at the growth profile of these two segments, these higher and more elevated rates, is that somewhat of a new norm for you guys in some regard in terms of -- especially on the Cap Markets side versus what it used to be? Like you mentioned 2015 was obviously negative [indiscernible] won't be there again, but just curious if you think the demand for that??? guys."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall So it's running their business and one of the things that we've been able to do in the Financial Services Vertical over the years, is be able to help those institutions run their business. We're taking that same model, Capital Markets, Treasury and Management, those things are really applicable across all of our client base. And so we talked about it in prior quarters as well, one of the things that happens even in our eCommerce clients, is they're looking for a partner that can offer a broad set of solutions that handle everything they need to do. That trend is continuing, and we are positioned exceptionally well to capitalize on that."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Togut , and . Also appreciate the expanded disclosure on merchant KPIs. Looking at slide 17, you highlighted 12 percentage point headwind to global e-commerce revenue growth, looking at the two-year stack versus 2019. As you look to 2022, merchant solutions revenue growth, how do you expect to travel and airlines or like global travel recovery to progress in terms of thinking through what your growth rate could be next year in merchant solutions?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Gary Norcross I'd just add. It's going to be a good tailwind for us going into 2022, and into 2023, but the reality is given the nature of our eCommerce business and how rapidly it's growing, you see the disclosure there  almost mid 30% the last several quarters and trending up. P&A will become a smaller and smaller segment of our overall business. And so that's what we're really thrilled about our positioning in the merchant space. As you look at that business, we are best positioned in the market area that's growing the fastest and so -- and we've got industry-leading capabilities there. So as long as we continue to execute on it, like Woody said, we're seeing a little slowing in the recovery in [indiscernible] but the good news is the other side of the business is actually accelerated a little faster in some of the verticals. So all-in-all, we've got a  business model and we've got one that's going to continue to perform in the double-digits going forward in 2022 and beyond."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Togut I appreciate that. And just as my follow-up, Woody, could you expand upon your commentary for 2022, Free Cash Flow outlook. FiServ cut their Free Cash Flow outlook for this year by 10% last week, just want to make sure I understand your comment on Free Cash Flow conversion for 2022 versus 2021?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall Yeah. I haven't given you a free cash flow conversion for 2022 yet. That said, we don't anticipate any reduction in our conversion metrics or ratios. This quarter we did 33% in terms of revenue conversion in a 107%, in terms of adjusted earni ngs conversion. I feel very good going into 2022, that we'll continue to be generating those levels of free cash flow conversion as we've previously guided. High 20s being the revenue item, and roughly 90% plus on adjusted net earnings going forward. So no, we're not having to pull back any cash flow conversion for investment or anything else. We're very good about how we're positioned going into 2022."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dave Koning To start off -- it's such a hot button topic would just every metric as it pertains to '19. And I think your U.S. numbers -- I think were 125% MasterCard, and Visa, maybe high 120%. The [indiscernible] would just say, well, that signals that you're losing share but is there really a bullish argument to say it's just a mix issue and if anything, as you catch up, that means there is out-sized growth coming? Do you think it's just a mix issue that causes a little bit of gap?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall And I will just add that operationally, we're seeing a lot of sales acceleration as well. You go back from last year to this year; you're seeing an increase in close rates on deals. So a lot of positive momentum in the merchant space for us across the board actually."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dave Koning Got you. Well,  for that. And then just secondly, as we look at just sequential trends in Merchant, I know, in '19, I think Merchant was up 9% sequentially that seemed to be more normal. Last year was actually down sequentially. Is this year just back to that more normalized pace and maybe what was so different about last year?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall Yeah. Comparing '19, we think it's a more normalized pace going forward. We're going to use some color that we think the fourth quarter continues to accelerate sequentially and compared to the 2019, two-year stack. So we think we're just headed back in the right direction, Dave."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"George Mihalos [Indiscernible]  for all the improved disclosure in all the data out there. I guess, first question for me, if we look at slide 22, just talking about the double-digit growth that you're expecting for merchant going forward. Is the right way to think about it for global e-commerce that that business should be able to sustain growth rates call it kind of in the high-teens? And is that increases as a percent of revenue -- I would think that would be accretive to your revenue yield, right? You should be able to increase that and that there's no reason should you get back to where you were in 2019, if not higher, going forward, is that the correct assumption?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall Yeah. A couple of things in there. First, we've tried to give some color that we think, on a normalized basis, global eCom will grow 20%+ for us. So that certainly helps as we get to a larger and larger portion of o ur revenue mix. I think there's been at least some skepticism that we won't be able to support double-digit Merchant growth for the long term. And we really tried to highlight that, that we do not believe that is the case, with global eCom really helping us drive that accelerating growth longer-term and also to sustain that accelerated growth longer term. But I think you're right. We continue to see yields coming back as we thought. We think over time as everything normalizes out, call it into 2022, you'll see those yields where they were pre, with continued double-digit revenue growth within the merchant business."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"George Mihalos Okay, that's . Really appreciate the 20%. I think that's really important to get out there. And just -- as a quick follow-up, just kind of going back to the capital allocation priorities, maybe a little bit on the spend in the M&A side. Woody, it sounds like again, we shouldn't really expect any sort of a change from capex perspective as a percent of revenue or anything like that going forward? And on the M&A, is that predominantly going to be focused on M&A within merchant or is it sort of a broader strike zone that you guys are targeting? ."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Gary Norcross Yeah. Look, I mean. George on our M&A strategy is really unchanged. We have an opportunity to have a wide aperture; we're looking for things that can accelerate our growth and continue to drive our growth from here. We're going to continue to -- I appreciate you pointing out, really, our capital allocation strategy has not changed other than we are raising our dividend starting next year about 20%, but what he talked through all the financial is that, it's really in material and the overall use of cash. So we've got a very open lens of our free cash flow to either buy companies or continue to buy back our share back, and you, as you saw. And so we think it's generational buying opportunity for FIS at the moment. We really leaned in, in Q3, but we'll continue to look for things that we think can accelerate our growth rate from where we are. Keeping in mind that really all 3 of our segments are really operating at some of the highest levels in their history. We just -- Q3 was the biggest quarter for Capital Markets and Banking, I think in its history of this Company. And so -- but meanwhile you see Merchant -- every trend will give you -- shows that Merchant's heading in the right direction at an accelerated rate over where it was pre -pandemic. And it's a very durable business -- all 3 are very durable business model. So if we can find M&A that complements that from a strategy standpoint that it expands that market, drives new TAM, grows us faster than we absolutely are going to be in the -- continued to be in the M&A business."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dan Dolev So I have a question and then I have a follow-up. You've got it. I have a question and then I have a quick follow-up. And I'm sorry if I missed it. You did 16%, in this quarter,?COVID-19? and it sounds like you're very bullish into the fourth quarter. Are we talking about high-teens? Or are we talking about potentially having a?2 handle? on this, in terms of the comparison versus '19, and where you are seeing October trends and then I've got a quick follow-up?"
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall Yeah. Consistent with how we described it last quarter, we expect mid-t-high teens growth compared to 2019, in both the third and the fourth quarter. We did 16% on that comparison in the third quarter, I actually anticipate a bit of sequential growth into the fourth quarter but still keeping with the mid-to-high teens comparison to 2019."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dan Dolev Got it. Makes sense. And then regarding restaurants, I know this was like -- if I look through their release, this seems to be maybe the only thing that's not as good there. I know -- I think Gary, you mentioned at the beginning that you're still [Indiscernible] there. Does it make sense to keep operating in that space or is there at some point where you're saying, well, I'm better off focusing on where my forte is like eCommerce, etc.? Coming from a [Indiscernible] strategy perspective."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Gary Norcross Yeah. Dan, look, I obviously will continue to lead in e-com. We're going to continue to lean in on that. Our software-led strategy and SMB, though has been very sound since the start. Woody did a  -- I think a very good job of describing what's going on in our software-led initiatives and SMB specifically. You have seen restaurant starting to recover, it's a very small overall percentage of our Company. So it's really a bit of immaterial at this point in time. But you have seen it starting to recover, and whether that was due to closures, whether that was due to staffing issues, whether that was due to some of our software partners, didn't respond to some of the changing needs as quickly as they might should have during the  pandemic. All of that would be open debate, but we feel very good about our software-led strategy within SMB. And going to that, the team has done a  job of continuing to sign up partners throughout the pandemic. Bruce just highlighted our sales strength. And that's not just an SMB. Our strength in e-com has been fantastic. And what we've seen driving across our e-commerce segment, we've disclosed a lot here on what we're seeing the growth rates going on with and without travel, you can actually see travels improvement Q2 to Q3, which Woody talked about from a domestic standpoint. And now we've got to start leaning in international, but the business is really solid across all of those fronts. And we will continue to go to the SMB market through our software-led strategy."

Appreciate the direct addressing of some of these questions from investors. As we digest that, it's quite clear that you've done a lot on the cost of delivery front between Cloud and componentization and so on. Can you speak to ongoing innovation, perhaps the level of intended spend? How do you stay nimble? Do you need a consulting or SI set of relationships as tip of the spear that you need to build out from a channel perspective? Thoughts on that would be ."

4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ashwin Shirvaikar Understood. Looking at Chart 22 as well, global acquiring TAM and it's a  chart. One of the things that sticks out obviously, is you are very big in the enterprise segment and that's how it's been for years. But that also happens to be the slower [indiscernible] So in terms of just actively pivoting your mix towards faster growth areas, could you talk a little bit more about that particular strategy? Obviously, you have to stay exposed to enterprise because the dollar's at large but how do you -- more -- how do you tail it faster? It's the question."
4465486,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.",FIS,11/4/2021,CEO Gary Norcross on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Woody Woodall Yes, Ashwin, it's a . I think you've heard us over the last several quarters. And really even pre -acquisition on Worldpay that the Worldpay team. And we believe it was the right strategy continues to focus on invest on e-com and to drive e-com growth even faster. If you remember, this 27% of our revenue mix in the highest growing segment was a significantly lower but 4 to 5 points lower than that just a few years ago. So most of our investment in geo -expansion, most of our investment in nap, most of our investment in access Worldpay continuing to improve speed of on-boarding capabilities in market and investment that growth profile, that's absolutely were where we've been focusing. Further, if you go back to the global e-commerce slide, where we talk about it specifically, our mix right now is 50-50 between domestic and cross-border. We think we can also grab some incremental e-commerce market share over time in a pretty high growing SMB market where we real ly don't play today. So yes, that's where a lot of our focus is, is to drive this portion of our revenue mix up significantly. Hopefully, over time, getting in as much as 50% of our total revenue mix in these high-growth markets. And we think that's an excellent way for us to continue to sustain very strong growth in the merchant segment."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joshua Shanker Yes. . I want to talk about bundles and homeowners in the pricing of the dual engine of homeowners and auto together. I guess there's two things I want to understand. One is when a customer sees their overall bundled price going up, what does the conversation like, especially if you're trying to more centralized your business with a er direct relationship with your customers. And 2, given Allstate's geographic footprint, can Allstate add incoming customers for homeowners without changing its cap footprint."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Wilson , Josh is Tom, I'll start and then Glenn can jump in first as you know, we've long been focused on bundling auto and homeowners because those are good, stable, long-term customers. You do get a discount for putting those two together. So there's an advantage to the customer from buying it and putting it all in one place besides just having 1 point of contact. And we've been good at that. If you look at our growth in Homeowners this year. It's higher than our growth in auto insurance. And data appears to be because we are doing more bundling of individual customers, it a little hard to get the exact attribution, but we feel good about what our agents are doing to drive that. As it relates to the Gross event. We've been we've repositioned as business over multiple years back in the middle -- late 2 thousand decade of 2,000, we've made of course a bunch of money since over the last eight or nine years, I think almost $9 billion of underwriting income on homeowners which you need to do because we don't believe that a 4 point margin is attractive for homeowners for a couple of reasons. One is you don't get much investment income. Secondly, you got to put up more capital because the results are more volatile and you have the big tail losses. So as we seek to grow it, we bring all of that math to bear. On individual states is where we grow. And so if there's a state where even if there's a fair amount of catastrophe exposure but we think we can get a good return, that's got a margin on it that compensates us for the capital we have to put up and the reinsurance we have to buy, then we'll do that. And we're highly sophisticated in the way we run it. So the geographic focus is really -- we have a much highly sophisticated model into it. On the direct business, you don't sell as much direct homeowners right now, we still need to crack the code on that. Before I -- Glenn will have some view on how we can continue to run the table in homeowners as we have so far. But the -- an upcoming thing that Glenn might want to touch on, is what we're doing in the independent agent channel because of the National General platform gives us, with our products, our expertise, our pricing,  our claims management. And our reinsurance programs gives us the ability to really serve a lot of customers. [Indiscernible]"
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joshua Shanker Glenn, where [Indiscernible] I just want to say, can you address retention and cat footprints as well?"
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Wilson Hey [Indiscernible] let me just ask that because I think I understand why you're trying to triangulate between what's going on in the industry. First, we don't have a catastrophe exposure problem. We don't have a profitability problem. We believe in homeowners. We only made about -- we lost about $16 million bucks and $7.3 billion so far this year. So we'd like to make more money, but as Glenn pointed out, when you look over a longer period of time, we've had a fair amount of ups and downs, but we still make underwriting profit sense of 12-month basis. So we don't have a catastrophe problem. So we don't have to restrict stuff and end up with -- what you're poking at is retention issues. We have been there and done that though And it was called the repositioning we did in the latter part of the decade I mentioned. And when you call a customer and say, I used to have -- you used to be insured with us and now I am not going to insure your thoughts and we were one of the biggest brokers have homeowners insurance products. I think in the country and maybe Vegas. And through o ur advantage in even when you say to people, here's another Company. It has some impact on your auto business. So because people are like, Well, I'll take my business someplace else or competitors decide they want to, they want to bundle and they'll go get those customers as well. We had some issues with auto growth when we were downsizing. We went down by 2 million policies in the homeowner's business over a 4, 5 year-period. It does hurt. It's manageable. I can't speak for what our competitors are going to do. What I do know is what Glenn said, which is we got a good business, we know how to run it. We have growth opportunities, and we're looking forward to serving more customers and make more money for our shareholders along the way."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Greg Peters . I'd like to turn your attention to Page 7, and I was particularly struck by your chart where you've identified the rate increases you've deployed, and then ones that you're going to be implementing. And I was wondering if you could provide us some perspective on -- given the fact that severity has been so substantial, where you think that's going to go with other states? It feels like this is going to be an ongoing reset of pricing as we go through most of next year. And against that backdrop, just how you think about your competitive positioning when most of the industry is going to be raising rates."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Shapiro Yes. Absolutely. So , Greg. And you hit a couple of important points that you're right about that everyone or close to everyone is going to have to take rate. When you talk about competitive position. So we think about that as part of process. But this is broad and this is going to be around for a while, like everything you look at in terms of what the root causes of severity, which is in its simplest terms, is the price of used cars. I would like to talk about collision coverage as it's a coverage that doesn't really have a policy limit that's dated other than the value of the vehicle itself. So in real turn, our policy limit on that coverage went up by 40% plus with no change in premium. And that experience happened to everybody across the industry. So it's a rarity where you have something is Clean and clean as that that is a root cause to your severity changes. So we think it will be around for a bit and we're going after rate to address that has one of the levers and we've talked about our claims capabilities and certainly our expense reductions as other ones. So in the third quarter, we took 12 price increases that went effective in the third quarter and other 8 in the fourth quarter so far with more to come. So this is broad and we'll be doing it just about everywhere. And I think the key from a competitive position is that we made a lot progress. So our starting point, we made significant progress over the last year with the expenses we've taken out, and therefore the competitive position we were in improved significantly. Our close rates improved significantly, leading to some of the er new business that you saw. And so as we take rates and other due. It's our goal certainly keep that competitive position gain that we've made. But the primary goal is to get our margins back to where they need to be. And that's why we're going after rate, we're doing it pretty proactively."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Greg Peters .  for the color on that. I wanted to pivot to Slide 8, which is, I think another really important slide in your presentation. And just to step back and recognize the long-term objective that you've introduced is pretty striking. I feel like when we get to 2024, if you've achieved that objective, that will put you clearly among the leaders in terms of a lowest adjusted expense ratio in the marketplace. I'm sure a lot of thought went into this. Can you give us some more color on where the improvement, where you're going to get the most leverage in terms of the expense ratio improvements, where it's going to come from. And then maybe also include some comments on the advertising expense because that's not included in this."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Elyse Greenspan All right, . . My first question was on the growth in new business that you guys saw in direct in the quarter. I know from commentary, you guys started to take price during the quarter and then more is on the [Indiscernible], but I was a little bit surprised with the level of growth you saw there, given the increase, the loss trend that you're mentioning. Can you expand upon that? And would you expect a new business growth on the direct side to slow as you push for additional ways through this system?"
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Shapiro Yeah. I agree there any Tom just said I think we've got really nice prospect because I would say we're making up ground in dog years because we have what we're 20 years newer at doing directed the Allstate brands and some of our competitors. But we're making up chunks of that capability as we move a year-and-a-half into the launching with Allstate brand in direct. The effectiveness of our sales, whether it be our call centers, or on the web, etc., our marketing sophistication, our partners with marketing, all of those things getting better and that helps move it up. The other thing is, actually in this price environment that's going to be disrupted, we're really likely to see some tailwind in new business, but some headwind in retention. Because if we were in a situation where we're the only ones taking rate, you might expect the opposite. But with a whole bunch of people having to take rate that will create a lot of shoppers, we'll create shoppers of our own too, because it disrupts our own customers. And when people shop, they often find a better price for situation. Even in a rising environment like this. So there will be a lot of customers shopping, ours, and other companies. And so, it's an opportunity as Tom said, to leverage what we did and say we're really happy we did transformative growth when we did because we have more ways for customers to buy when that disruptive market happens."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Elyse Greenspan . And then my second question on, just in terms of rate, I believe the majority of your auto policies is six months, so correct me if I'm wrong there, but as we think about the rate going to this system, what you've done in the third quarter, the fourth quarter, and expectations for next year. How long would you -- do you think it will take to get back to your target margins, is it kind of a 6 month to 12 months situation? I know you don't have a specific target margins for Property-liability. We've gon e to an overall awry, but we think about putting your margins at an acceptable level that we think that that would come over the next 6 to 12 months or can you give us the time range there?"
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Shapiro I know that the only thing I would add would be that the tactical answer on the rates, because completely agree. We don't know what the bottom line will do exactly, so we'll have to keep moving those and adjust. But the tactical answer on the rates, you're correct, Elyse, its 6 months in almost all of our states and all of our policy. So it's about 6 months from the effective date to get all customers paying that. And then another 6 months from the point they start paying it to where the full premium has been earnings for one policy period. So you really start to see the effect of the rates starting at the beginning of the year, but more impactfully in the second and third quarters of next year."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Phillips , , everybody. I think Glenn answered this question, but just want to be sure. I'm going to ask First Quarter, Second Quarter you were taking some targeted rate costs and now you're not. And I think Glenn said rate increases that are going to continue are going to be I think you said just about everywhere. I Just want to confirm that because I guess the question would be, how much of an overlap would there be in states where you took previous rate cuts -- pretty recent rate cuts, and now moving upward in those same states, is there overlap there in those states? I'm asking because of what that means to consumer impact on maybe retentions, seeing gyrations down and back up again. And then also if there is overlap there, what it means for, just something that Tom said, make sure we have pricing rates to confidence around our current rates."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Shapiro Sure. So the short answer to your question would be yes, there will be increases in places where there were modest decreases. I do think we waited a little while to really see what was happening with the frequency and ensure that it was long-standing and has remained a long-standing benefit before taking them. And we were modest and we've done some pretty significant givebacks into shelter in place, get it back, which were one-time and not sort of durable discount. Actually changing rates and moving them down, we were more subtle with and more modest with. I don't think people will see a wild swing down and backup, but they will see it in same-state. And the simple fact is, as you saw on the chart, I believe just on page -- bottom page 7, that used car prices spiked dramatically in the second quarter. And those spike, and then people start having claims. And then those claims start to be paid, working their way into the loss costs, and you have this hyper inflationary environment on auto physical damage lines. So it's just the appropriate response at the appropriate time for it. And we'll do everything we can to maintain our retention. It's one of the wonderful things -- one of the many wonderful things about our agency force. Our agency force do a really good job of building relationships and talking customers through changes in their policies, and helping us through things like this."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Phillips Okay.  very much for that. The second question, a different one on Arity. I guess I'm curious how you think about Arity. Do you think of it as either a more of a use it for our own pricing and telematics business, or that plus [Indiscernible] it off to others and having more of a income-generating machine? It's still not giving you a lot of lift on that second piece, but do you think of it more that way longer-term? And we've seen more and more Companies go the route. You are about the only one that isn't. the go the route of farming that business off, Hartford just announced that recently were they farmed it off, and more and more companies are doing that. So how do you think about Arity? Is it more just for your own pricing or do you want to have it be more of a, again, an income generating machine as well?"
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Wilson Michael,  for a sking about something other than auto insurance margins, because we have a lot of good things going on, one of which is Arity, which a significant value has been created with Arity, both in the insurance business and outside the insurance business. And I don't think that's been reviewed by any analysts as if it was a separate Company. I mean, we have 600 billion miles of data. We risk scoring the operation. We help people do marketing, more effectively and efficiently. And so we're really building quite a platform that will do a number of things. One is it does exactly what you've talked about, which is -- and the way we started, it was telematics as a service for us. We needed somebody to collect the data. We needed to get a mobile app up. We needed to put it in files and be able to do something with it. And so rather than do that inside the insurance Company, we decided to do it outside the insurance Company because we said this is -- at the point, we said this is Basically a service at other insurance companies will need and we can provide to them and we do. So. Arity provides that service to some other insurance companies, and we're working to try to expand that effort for them. But it moved beyond what I would just call telematics as a service, help me pull data in to figure out all my customers are doing too. We started collecting more data from ourselves and built a rating service organization so that we can help other insurance companies use telematics to price the insurance. We believe that they're going to get their capability anyway. So we think that we might as well do it through Arity, and capture addition -- additional margin, rather than just assumed that we can take over a 100% of the insurance industry. But being a leader in telematics, which we are, but we don't think we can get the entire market share. So we created a rating services organization around that. It's then been expanded to include really lead generation. As we started collecting more data. So we have data from the Allstate customers, we have data because we have our SDK embedded in other people's thoughts. We have had data and I think it's over 25 million cars were pulling every day, really high fidelity data that's in the same format. We also buy data that we're able to combine with that 25 million on an over another 75 million current. So we're pulling data on a 100 million cars per day right now. And so we're building this rating services organization for all state and other insurers so that we can not only do telematics to the servers. We can do that. We think we can actually work to help people pre -qualify buyers and it's called the Arity IQ. So significant value has been created. I don't think that shows up in shareholder value today because I don't really see any of the analysts really looking hard and saying what's it worth, but we think it's substantial value and we expect to continue to grow their business and expand its total addressable market."
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Motemaden Hi, . . I had a question on, I think it was Slide 7, where you show the around a 7% rate increase that you are asking for. I guess that feels high to me, especially considering that the loss ratio, if I take out the reserve charge, was only about 1.5 points higher than the third quarter of 2019. And then also, considering the expense initiatives that you guys have taken to-date, I guess my thought was -- I thought that the expense plan would maybe help reduce the amount of rate that you guys would need to take. I guess -- is that the right way of thinking about it or is it too uncertain at this time and you guys just want to get in front of what might be coming down the road in terms of future loss cost increases?"
4465493,The Allstate Corporation,ALL,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Wilson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Wilson At some point, Glenn. Look, we need to make money in auto insurance, David, and we're going to do that. I think we're out of time, so let me just say as we move forward, you should expect us, as you've heard throughout this call, to focus on improving returns in auto insurance. At the same time, we're not letting up on any of the components of increasing our market share and personal property-liability, or expanding circle of protection. All of which we've had really good progress and success on this year and in this quarter, so you should expect us to continue to focus on a broad-based approach to increasing shareholder value. So  for your engagement with us again, and we will talk to you next quarter. , ladies and gentlemen for your participation at today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Konosky Morning, this is Matt Gawronski (ph) on for John. In the past, you mentioned that Kemerton maybe able to ramp the 40% to 50% of capacity in a year following its commissioning and qualification process. Is this still the case for that first line that's supposed to be done with construction at the end of this year? Or is it going to take some additional time due to the constraints going on right now?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kent Masters So after that I think we got to get through mechanical completion then we've got the commissioning qualification. So -- and then I think what we've said is after that and that's about a 6-month process. Then after that, we think we would be able to ramp to maybe 50% in the first 12 months. That's probably a little aggressive, but that -- that's what we're targeting. And then, I think the labor and all those issues are primarily around construction. We've got operators in -- staffed and onboard, and they're helping with commissioning so, I mean, the labor market is going to be tied, and we'll -- we may fight to keep the ones we want, I'm not sure, but the real labor issue is around construction."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Konosky .

4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"P.J. Juvekar So now that you expect lithium prices to be flat to up for this year and sort of down, are you -- must be expecting price gain in 4Q that are well into double-digits. Can you comment on that? And then, even as you look forward into next year, what percent of your contracts will be renewed next year? And do you have any early look into negotiations? ."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Norris So P.J., , it's Eric. I want to make sure I understand your first question. Your first question was, would they be double-digit in Q4, is that what you said?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,P.J. Juvekar Yes. As well into double-digits for Q4 for your pricing.
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Norris The way to think about pricing is and the flat-to-down comment is that it's progressive throughout the year. Prices were at their lowest point late last year and early this year and have been gradually rising as we've gone through the year due to 2 factors, 1 is the exploration and the concession we gave against a fixed priced long-term agreement. And the second would be just the movement of spot prices for that portion of our business is exposed to that -- those markets, which I'm sure you're aware, know. Those price has gone up significantly and throughout the course of the year. So as the guidance we've given, that Scott gave at Investor Day for next year, was at least 15% to 20% year-on-year increase for 2022 versus 2021. And certainly, that's a progressive trend. So you could certainly see those kinds of increases starting to happen in Q4 versus a year ago."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"P.J. Juvekar Okay, . And then on marble, you're restarting one of the 3 lines. Rock prices have skyrocketed, so why just 1 line? And then where would you concentrate that rock? Would that be at [Indiscernible]? Would that be in China? Can you just talk about that?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Laurence Alexander . First, on the bromine pricing, can you discuss how much of that you feel was transitory versus sustainable given the demand trends you're seeing? And can you give any sense of the magnitude of the chlorine headwind for this year, so that we have some better context for the larger-than-this-year headwind next year?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Raphael Crawford I think, in terms of the pricing, we could probably  figure most of that is transitory. It's based on the raw materials pricing that we pay and in the ability for us to absorb that and managed as we price forward. And in terms of the chlorine impact, it's more of a timing issue. We're going to get more chlorine next year, probably a different price than we're going to get this year. So you'll see that really impact us starting woefully in Q1 next year throughout the year."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Laurence Alexander And then with Catalysts, the recovery next year, how much of your -- should that be lighting or coincident with production ramp-ups at the refineries?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Harris Yeah, this is actually Mike Harris sitting in for Bob. If I could, might ask a question around the Lithium business, looking at the energy storage related sales, why is there a potential 1 to 2 quarter lag behind the EV production versus those sales actually, maybe leading?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Norris Yes, Mike, it's Eric here. It's simply a factor of the length of the supply chain. Lithium is consumed in the cathode material, which then is formulated into -- an electrode that's put into a battery. The battery is then assembled and then put into an ED car so that it's just the length of time that takes and the geographies involved. Most of the cathode -- nearly all the cathode production and a good amount of the battery production still is in Asia. And of course cars are produced various points around the world. So it's just the length of the supply chain. We are -- we see that lag, but recall we're well-positioned, we' re able to supply anywhere in the world. So we look -- we are well-positioned to grow with the industry, but that lag is likely to remain there, given the length of the supply chain."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Harris Got it. Okay. That helps. And then also, just as a follow-up, when I think about lithium recycling, can you give me an idea of what kind of assumptions you guys have made around recycling and perhaps the potential impact on your business, if any at all?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Huang Hi there. This is David Huang here for Dave. I guess, 1st, can you talk about your feedstock [Indiscernible] strategy for that 150K ton of lithium hydroxide capacity you're adding in China?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Raphael Crawford I'm sorry. So that was the feed-stock strategy for the 150 new projects in China?
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Raphael Crawford So they'll be said with our [Indiscernible] coming out of Australia.
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Huang Okay. And then secondly, are there any incremental headwinds or tailwinds to your 2022 guidance you provided, I mean, [Indiscernible], especially for a [Indiscernible] or do you still standby those guidance?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Female_1 Hi, this is Bremer (ph) [Indiscernible] of Joel,  for taking my question. Just back on the pricing discussions in 2022, can you just give us a little bit more color on how the discussions with your lithium contract listeners are going? And then, are pricing mechanisms going to be similar in '22 to '21 or is there a move more to benchmark pricing?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Norris So the -- generally speaking, Bravey (ph), the discussions we're having with our customer s are for price increase next year per -- and that aligns with the guidance I gave you in the remarks just a few moments ago. We have a book of contracts we've had under our basket, I should say, for some years now. Those are going back either to -- well, those are -- the fixed portion of those contracts are going back to the original long-term agreement, which is significantly higher in some cases than the average price that we're seeing for 2021. And then there is many of those contracts have a variable component and there is no one contract that looks exactly like the other, but that variable component can. We will also see increases. Some of those variable components are tied to indices. Others are just an annual increase nomination that's possible, a max increase nomination. And then finally, we have a good deal of technical-grade contracts where we'll see rising prices based upon an adjustment to what -- the rises we've seen this year, as we roll into next year. The last piece would be our China spot business. And that -- hard to say that we'd see a pretty big increase on that next year because prices are already extraordinarily high in China right now. But we'll continue to see possibly some upside on a year-over-year basis, particularly in the early part of the year, next year on that. So those are all the components that are driving our increase and types of discussions we're having with our customers which will give us nice leverage, upside leverage to the improving market conditions."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Female_1 Okay, that's certainly helpful. . And then I guess just like given the large upswing in LFP demand in recent tests of commentary, with that background, I just want to understand how you're thinking about investments into carbonate versus hydroxide. It seems your incremental investments are mostly focused on hydroxide currently."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Zekauskas  very much. You've described your lithium prices as perhaps being up 15% to 20% or more next year. Is the 15% to 20% representative, given market conditions, could it be up 30?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ben Kallo  guys, and . One of the things that we are thinking about is -- I love to hear your perspective with materials maybe being a bottleneck for EV production sales. If that's -- how you guys view that as a risk? Just overall -- meaning, is there enough lithium reserve, enough copper reserve, enough nickel? And then, how are customers, I guess, approaching you [Indiscernible] and your competitors for security in the supply chain. Does that -- does your scale and your diversity of your resources give you an advantage there over other people [Indiscernible] Will be more [Indiscernible] wrap up. ."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Norris Then I'll just add on the lithium side of material risks. There's enough material, there's enough lithium out there. The issue is the investment required to get there and the fact that it's going to be at a higher costs. The cross curve is upward sloping as you go to lower quality lithium resources that are out there. The discussions we're having with our customers are ones of deep desire for commitment and partnership. That's both the existing ones we've had, and as we bring on new capacity, new ones that we would look to target. And that's at various points in the value chain, but I would tell you that the most significant and urgent discussions around security are the closer you get to the automotive OEM. And so I think our track record of executing gives us that advantage for sure. And I think that's where the discussions land as us being sort of a base load partner for many of these automotive and battery firms. So I do think that's an advantage we have for sure."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ben Kallo , guys. It's about to get too ahead ourselves here, but are you at a point that you are allocating to customers? So you're picking your customers more than they are picking you or is it not like that? And , guys."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Male_1 Hi. This is [Indiscernible] to you on for Vincent.  for taking our question. Just back to the Huntsman arbitration, curious. What other alternatives are there in terms of discontinued process. I know you mentioned you've started to have discussions around settlement. So what other -- from a legal perspective, what other alternatives are there? And then how should we think about the timing of all of this?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kent Masters Well, I think it's -- it's a range. And we're not going to get into too much because there's an active process. So it is either through the arbitration process or from discussions that we've initiated that we would be able to -- that we could potentially reach agreement and resolve that matter. But it's a pretty -- those are the options and it's the time frame is pretty wide."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Male_1 Understood. And then as we think about Kemerton and your ability to fulfill those contracts particularly Kemerton 2 given the longer delay, will those be fulfilled through more tolling or how should we think about the volume and how that will be allocated in terms of -- as we think about next year, 2023, would that be less volume overall or just lower margin from tolling?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Cory Murphy Hi, . This is Cory Murphy on for Kevin. I wanted to follow on -- I think it was PJ's question earlier about Wodgina, you said you were starting up one line and it looks like it's going to start production maybe in the third quarter of 2022. Can you help me understand what the delays are or why the restart process seems to take maybe upwards of 6 to 10 months? And then given spodumene prices, why wouldn't you startup or try to start up all three lines? Are you able to sell the spodumene on the spot market or is it that there's contractual reasons not to?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kent Masters Well, it's -- on the selling spodumene, it's really strategic reasons, is that we want to convert it and sell the finished products to customers where we'd make commitments and we have long-term arrangements. So we might sell some spodumene here in there, but that's not our strategy. And then the starting up -- I mean, we might -- we're going to do -- start to first train then other. It's really neat to be in line with our conversion capacity. And then that timeline that you referenced where 6 or whatever the timeframe is to get it going, you've got labor issues in Western Australia, we face the same things there that we do at Kemerton to some degree, and really the lead time is on some of the big equipment that's necessary in mining, some of the yellow -- we call it -- they call it yellow equipment, that's necessary in operating these mines and the lead time on that."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Cory Murphy Understood. That's very helpful. And then I just wanted to ask about tolling as well. It sounds like there's more tolling due  to labor shortages or labor strikes in Chile. How would your volume trend without tolling? And when do you anticipate rolling off the tolling contracts related to the La Negra startup? I think you said you're bridging some capacity with that.
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Colin Rusch Guys,  so much for all of these information. I'm curious about the order patterns from your customers. And this is a cross the you [Indiscernible]. If you're seeing any sort of double ordering that you can track or track all of the sell-through for those individual customers. Just it seems like that there may be some folks trying to build some inventory or really trying to give character or any other incremental demand that they could mean."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Colin Rusch Okay. , guys. And then just on the lithium content per kilowatt hour, are you guys seeing any real trend lines on that? Certainly as some of these battery chemistries change. And folks are looking to figure out how to optimize some of the materials. Are you seeing lithium content increase, decrease, hold steady? And where would you peg that level right now?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arun Viswanathan ,  for taking my question. I guess I had a question just on the contracting process here. What are you hearing from your customers as far as length? Are those contracts in lithium extending out now to 4 or 7 or 10 years? And then when you when you do those contracts, how do you kind of bridge the divide between this huge spot price of $28,000 plus per ton and something more reasonable and more in line with the increases from where you are on the contract side. I guess I'm just asking. Are you -- have you seen a material rise in the cost curve that would justify contracts going closer to spot? ."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Norris I would say that there is -- the duration of requests from customers are increasing. I think we've characterized in the past, and on average it's about 3 years in our current mix. The new contracts under discussion, which would be slated to supply against the China expansions that Kent described, or future Kemerton expansions, or even down the road expansions we could have in the U.S. Those discussions are either 5-year plus or they don't even start until 2024, 2025. So we're having discussions with certain customers who are contracting for increments of time into the future, say '23 to '26, or '24 or '28. Those are the kinds of durations that people are thinking about and that's largely driven by the investments made on the automotive side. From a pricing standpoint, you can imagine because prices are rising, there's certainly a desire on behalf of those buyers to see what they can to not have to pay spot prices. But the reality is they either -- the discussion is either towards a much higher fixed price if they want some stability in their pricing term, or we're pricing against an established index so that it will rise with time. Now, remember the price you gave was a spodumene price when you said $2,800 a ton, the pricing in China is, on a U.S. basis is in the high 20s, close to 30 on a delivered basis. When you look at many of the indices around the w orld, most of these people are buying against a blend, and so the pricing around that is not quite as high, but it's still well into the high teens, if not the low 20s of what a lot of those pricing indices are. So we continue to have a discussion with customers and -- but those are some of the dynamics at play, which are leading us to long-term contracts with significantly higher price potential than what we're -- we've seen in the past."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arun Viswanathan ,  for that. And then, I guess, just wanted to ask about the -- if there's any risk that you see on the political front in Chile -- yeah, it's a broad question -- I guess in the next month or two or so?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Deyoe . So we touched a bit on tolling. I want to delve a little bit into it a little bit more because I know you said it's a bridging strategy and maybe we can be opportunistic. But you're sitting on a fair amount of latent capacity at Greenbushes. And the read seems to be that converters are struggling to find enough merchant supply of spodumene to actually continue to operate in some respect, so why not get more aggressive on the volume? I have to think: 1. Prices right now are really attractive but, 2. Almost somewhat concerning as it relates to the potential for over-investment and overheating in markets and things like that etc. I feel like if you -- with your volume, you might have an ability to kind of regulate this a little bit."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kent Masters Yeah. So I'll make a comment, and Eric can add some color on it. We don't -- we can't just turn a toller on because we -- they are going to our customers, we have to qualify them. So there is a process there. And not all of those tollers would qualify with our customers. So it's not -- we can't just turn them on. It's not quite that simple, even if we had the products. So now we're ramping and getting more spodumene going. It could give us optionality from a spodumene standpoint going forward, but we still have to make sure we choose the ones, and Eric talked about it, before they're people, they're tollers that we have relationships with that have been previously qualified or currently qualified with our customers. So you have to fit in all of those elements into it to really ramp it up. It would be a -- it's not a 6 months strategy. It's going to take a little longer to implement that."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kent Masters Yeah. And key for us is, for me, that -- again, security of supply quality for the customer. The customers have to trust us. So if we're going to toll, we have to make sure that product meets our specs and our customer's standards as well."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Deyoe Fair point. And we almost got there with Jeff's question. But if you look at Chinese bromine price, I know in the past it's been comments or maybe it's not correct on an absolute basis, but directionally it's consistent with what you're seeing. So given the move, should we think of this move as real and capturable in any capacity? And if so, is this a 2-year process, a 1-year process, a 3-year process? It would seem like there's a lot of room to offset higher chlorine costs as well. But I'm not sure if that's the case or not."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Harris Fein Hi. This is Harris Fein on for Chris.  for taking my question. Turning back to Wodgina, so how should we be thinking about the cost that's associated with bringing that back into production and then understanding that Greenbushes is in a class of its own when it comes to cost per ton. How should we be thinking about the relative cost of spodumene that comes ou t of Wodgina?"
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kent Masters Maybe say, in the ballpark. And I think, Scott, the costs for this, Harris was asking about how to [Indiscernible] there. We've captured them in the guidance we provided, both capital and cash flow. It's largely joint venture capital costs to acquire this yellow equipment that we've talked about and ramp the JV."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Harris Fein Got it. And then a lot of the Wave 3 announcements that you've made so far, actually all of them that have been disclosed, are really planned in China. So I'm curious what the strategic rationale was to focus so much on China. And I'm wondering whether it was a matter of lower capital costs or whether or not you see the Chinese market drifting more towards high nickel. And whether or not you expect most of those tons to stay domestic or make their way into other markets."
4465511,Albemarle Corporation,ALB,11/4/2021,CEO Kent Masters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Norris You know, I mean, I think if you look at the percent of production of cathode on the world market, China is well over half of it today and that will increase between now and the middle of the decade. So China is the center of the world for all cathode technologies. Now, many of those are being developed. The supply chain is being developed prospectively to come into and match up to battery production ultimately in North America  and Europe. And that's why we have a wave 4 plan that addresses that and we will speak to those opportunities to localize supply and it's an active program with us. But as we've said many times, wave 3 is largely Asia - centric, heavily China focus because that's where the market is. And we will build that repeatability of capital design and execution there that will serve us well as we continue to grow around the world. It's also where a large -- more of our resources are in Asia -- a bit Australia, but in the Asia region as opposed to the Western part of the world. So those are all the elements that play that strategy. And we look forward to growing with our customers as they expand into the West. There are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kent Masters for closing remarks. Okay. . And  all again for your participation on our call today. As we approach the end of the year, I'm extremely pleased with the progress and the focus our team has demonstrated. I look forward to updating you in February when we announced full-year results and provide more detail on 2022 objectives and outlook. This concludes our call and  for your interest in Albemarle. Ladies and gentlemen,  for your participation in today's call. You may now disconnect at this time."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Myles Walton Was hoping I could just start with the shipbuilding revenue outlook and maybe less specific to the revenue outlook, more specific to what you're seeing in the labor workforce and moving to the low-end of this range. Is that anticipating things that you haven't seen yet as it relates to the covered mandate and what it coul d do to attendance, and workforce, or is it more of what you saw in the third quarter? If you get where I'm going."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Steely Hey, , Myles, it's Tom. I'll start with that one. So, from an outlook perspective, we did go to the bottom end of the range. As you recall, we gave you 2 to 8 for the beginning of the year. As we see how the quarter played out right now, what's left in front of us right now. We -- when I move to shipbuilding revenue expectation that $8.2 billion. A couple of points on that right now, we're a little light on material specifically at Ingalls. If you look from a Newport News perspective, net revenues were flat. Obviously, a little look back from a PTC perspective, but when we're talking about shipbuilding, the material lag behind roughly about $40 million in the quarter. And as we look forward into Q4. All right. That could persist. You don't see significant labor oppression at this time that's going to impact our revenue. We have a keen on right now with the EO and the mandate and how that's changing very dynamic situation there, as well as keeping an eye on our supply chain to see how the material flows here. But it's just timing right now as we see the outlook. And as I say, it's still in the range that we gave you at the beginning of the year."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Myles Walton Okay. And what is the percent of the workforce that's currently vaccinated and if there were perturbations, is it covered in your contracts because it's a new requirement being placed upon you."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Petters Right. Miles, this is Mike. Right now, we're, I'd say, roughly around 75%. We've seen a tremendous uptick in the last 30 days and folks getting the vaccine. I think the breaking news right now, it looks like the executive orders being moved out into January and the -- and they're talking about having your shot by January, not completely through the quarantine. So, we're going to have to interpret it how all that plays out. We're working very closely with our customers on how do you implement the executive order. I mean, the executive order is -- we've been -- we have been, from a policy standpoint, we have been directly aligned with what the white house put out. But as you hinted at there, the executive order is not contractual. And so, working with our customers on all of our contracts to figure out how best to implement that executive order is what we're doing, and we're doing that across the board. So, we're continuing to move ahead. Our ambition is to get as many of our employees vaccinated as we possibly can because we are committed to a safe workplace and we think that's the best way to do it."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Harned Right now, you are in the transition on Virginia-class for Block-4 to Block-5, could you comment on how block 5 looks in terms of the amount of content you have on that, and how would you describe any risks in the transition relative to the one you did when you move to block 4."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Chris Kastner No, I think that's right. And when you think through VCS and block 4 getting back to a cadence where we're floating off 1 vote a year and delivering 1 vote a year and then transitioning that workforce right into block 5 makes  sense. So, we have high hopes for performance on block 5 because of the lessons we're learning through block 4 when you get to a 2 per year cadence."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Harned And then, also in submarines,  you commented this time that your services revenues were down a little bit. Can you comment on where the 3 Los Angeles class ships stand in their process and how you see services, revenues at Newport News trending over the next couple of years here?"
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Chris Kastner Sure. Helena will -- this is Chris, Doug. Helena will deliver this year. Columbus is in process and moving through the cycle in their contract and Boise is really in their prompts start period. We're going to get into a place here. And I think in communication with our customer where it makes  sense to have sort of a consistent stream of work and revenue. It probably will not be as high as it's been going forward and we need to create that plan with our customer. That's the status of the three that are in Newport News now. And as I said, we're working with a customer to ensure we had a steady cadence of repair activity going forward."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Seth Seifman I wanted to start off. I think you mentioned a bit earlier that you were looking to finalize the single pay delivery agreement for the carrier with the Navy either late this year or early in 1Q. Again, can you tell us is there any margin or cash impact we should think about once that is finalized?"
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Chris Kastner Yes. This is Chris. We will definitize that, if not this year, it would be beginning of next. Don't anticipate significant or margin cash impact. It's obviously an increase in the top-line for that shift, but it also extends the risk retirement events out a couple of years because it extends the test program. So, nothing significant from a material from a sales margin or cash impact at this point."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Seth Seifman Okay. And then it seems like it's mostly a timing issue, but just wanted to ask about the cash flow guidance increase this year. Should we think about that increasing your kind of 5-year expectation or is it mainly having to do with the timing of when those progress payments go back to the government?"
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Steely . It's Tom. Yes, it is. The progress payments are the predominance of the change that we have right now. Obviously, another quarter with rich retirement, and we have actual -- through Q3 and we have a line of sight for the end of the year, but predominantly the change there was because of the progress payments not getting kicked into the 2022-time frame. Keep in mind to that year-end, [Indiscernible] we have to get back half of the payroll bike attacks that we did not pay in 2020. So that's baked into the numbers. So, it's timing and within the 32, it still holds."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ron Epstein I was wondering if you could give us just some more color and maybe just following up on Miles’s question about what's going on in your supply chain, where you're seeing some material shortages and is it just being driven by delays in transportation or what are good."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Steely Sure. Yeah, it's Tom here. I will take that one. So, we've had this conversation on the last couple of calls and we're watching that and intently, regularly to touch base with the supply chain offices out Cabot, each of the yard, some of speed exactly on where the stand right now, as we've given in the past, because of the nature of our long-term contracts, long-term material orders that start ahead of the construction of these contracts. And then obviously with the backlog that we have this spin-off contracting, you have line of sight of the work that's going to be performed in the yards. A significant amount of those requirements has already been put on order and we're managing them aggressively over the next [Indiscernible] material flows in hits the end-year need dates. Preponderance of the material is coming in on time and meeting the contractual needs that we have within the art. I would tell you that recently, less 3 to 6 months that as we have spot orders, what we're seeing is a little bit of volatility in pricing and the validity days of shrinking a little bit on things that we have spots high. But from a perspective of Execution of the existing contracts we have we don't see a significant impact at this time. Obviously, we're watching how the EO mandate impacts a supply chain. And the precious that we do, we do here are our second and fifth third tier were dependent on the raw materials. So copper cabling, things of that nature. But again, as we stand here today, the supply chain that we need because of how we've contracted at work in advance, has us maintaining schedule at this time."

And then on the Technical Services business, if we just open up the aperture a little bit and think about when we walk out 2, 3, 4 years from now, where do you see the margin in that business? I mean, presumably it's going to be much better than where it is today. And I'm just curious, I mean, if you can just give us -- I know you're not giving forward guidance, most companies don't do it. So, I'm not asking for that but just -- if you can put a little framework around how we should think about the margin in that business as we think longer term."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Steely Yes. So, because of how we put that division together with the acquisitions, purchase, intangibles, and things of that nature. If you noticed, we've been guiding and driving towards an EBITDA relationship against the performance and where we see. You've noticed from the announcement we had on the July time frame and then with July, close in August, we've got [Indiscernible] on how that was going to cause a lift there. From a rough perspective, we were at 45%. We dialed in from an EBITDA perspective to be in the 8% to 10% range by 2024. Both the initial guidance we gave you in the July time frame of Alion supported  that. As we sit today after the close in August and that close to the quarter with Alion cranked into our financials. They're hovering on the low end of the range right now so that's good news because that's more than 50% of that portfolio. I think going forward as we see those purchase intangibles get burnt off for the next 3, 4, 5 years going forward, obviously that's going to be an improvement. I would tell you that PI is baked into the rocks, although the rocks, even for this quarter TSD is 2.6% with $8 million of purchase intangibles when you roll that out at the 5.3% last quarter and the EBITDA is at 7% right now. So that's a near-term perspective and how I see it evolving in the out years."

Items moved to Q3. Can you just list what moved to Q3? And I thought you'd mentioned some might have moved to Q1 were so Next year. What do we expect in Q2 -- in Q4 for incentives versus what we had thought before?"
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Steely Hey, George. It's Tom here. . Yes. I'll take that. Just a couple of moving parts there. We guided Q2 going into Q3 would be licensed for it would be a little bit heavier than that. We have pulled a couple of incentives at Newport News on the RCOH fund from 73 to the left, as well as before? Ingalls taken DDG 121 to trials was a risk retirement evaluation on a bad so just a couple of moving parts there from Q3 to Q4. But we're still in the lane there of the 7.5% to 8% that we gave you for shipbuilding, for year-end. I didn't mention anything moving into next year. In my remarks, we do have LPD 28 moving or staying on contracting in the beginning of 2022."

And then just a separate one, probably more for Mike. I noticed that Newport News you got like -- they're a union contract with perfecting 50% of the workers up to November here now, so if you could give us what you think about the status here. I mean, I guess it's more in the news given the contract results at the end of the year."

We're in process with the Newport News union working through that contract with a very good relationship with them and I fully expect we can come to a reasonable agreement on a contract. I know Mike ran Newport News for a while, so he probably has for a long time actually, probably has better comments on that, but we're working with them every day to try to get to a resolution."

4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Safran So, it's -- on the Navy's new destroyer crews or class, the ship doesn't appear to be slated to arrive until very late in the decade. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that represents a bit of a slide to the right in terms of schedule. Could you discuss a timeline for a competition and following up on your opening remarks, I'm wondering how you think that the Navy strategy with the new ship now impacts to buy the new flight of DDG 51 since the new ship isn't arriving. Now for close to ten years down the line. I'm thinking that really reinforces the idea of a new flight of DDG, but that's my view is I was wondering what you think of that."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Petters This is Mike. I don't  think you're too far off there, just in general. I think general principles are -- it's really hard to pin down the development, path, and timeline for a new program like this, this early in the process. They are trying to work through -- how do they fund the design, how they fund the project? When are they going to have it, where the requirement is going to be? That's a pretty dynamic thing and so trying to pin that down precisely. It is a bit of a challenge. And our general view is that you don't really want to stop production of a line until you're ready to move to a mature design product going forward. So as that product matures, it will interact. The construction work that's going on So, DDGs today, the flight 3 ships will -- my -- we certainly will advocate and believe that the best prudent course ahead will be to continue to build flight threes until that designer is maturing. We're ready to go into production on that. And if that happens to be 20 something else, then it's 20 something else, and then we will be ready. As far as the competition for that goes, it'll -- that will just lay in as that program matures, we'll get more visibility into what the competition -- when it might be, what it would look like, and that sort of thing. I think it would be a mistake though for there to be any sort of curtailment in the de stroyer program. Anticipating some kind of maturation path. We kind of went down that path in a couple of programs during my career, we've done that with submarines. We did that, actually, with DDGs and we tried to transition over to the 1,000s and then transitioned back. So, we had a gap and then short program. Our industry is full of people who have seen gaps in production become tremendous problems for restarts of production. So, let's keep the production line moving. And when the production line, when the design to churn off to transition, we will transition it."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Safran Okay.  for that. And, you know, more general, I thought you could talk a little bit about efficiency initiatives while back we had things like digital transformation, but I thought you might discuss efforts to reduce costs and then in your answer, maybe you could talk about how much that might contribute to margin improvement. Any objective eventually, getting to 9% margins."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Chris Kastner This is Chris, I won't discuss the contribution to the margin rate. And when we expect to get to 9%, we'll talk a lot more about that on the year-end call. But the capital investments we've made in technology investments we've made both Ingalls and Newport News are going very well. And the simplest form at Ingalls getting all the work on undercover really drives efficiency if you've ever been in Mississippi in August and then the digital shipbuilding products are becoming more mature and help on the manufacturing and CVN 80 and the Columbia class. so, we're very encouraged by the technology investments in the capital investments we've made and we hope to continue to drive costs out of our products."

Chris, I think you say you're going to get the contract defeminization that's going to maybe move the risk registers to the right a little bit. I just want to make sure I'm in line with. I think I've been assuming that the Kennedy retirement opportunities, those retirement opportunities who will be 2022 2023. Is that still the case or are they shifted to the right at 24 or 25.

4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Strauss . . I wanted to ask about Alion. I think when you announced the deal, you talked about $1.6 billion in annualized revenue. Based when you do in the quarter and when you're applying for the year and it would seem like either it's running well below that or you're expecting big growth in ' 22. Can you just comment on that?"
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Chris Kastner David, this is Chris. I'd also add that the integration of the front end of that business has gone very well in business development and capture. We have a $60 billion total pipeline that we're working through and prioritizing a number of significant competitions over the next [Indiscernible]. and a book-to-bill at 1.8 in the quarter. So, all indications are positive for that business."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Strauss Okay.  for that. As a follow-up, I want to ask about the, Tom, the long-term free cash flow profile. Obviously, you're sticking with the 3.2. I think previously you had said that '22, '23, '24, that time frame would be fairly -- free cash flow over that period will be fairly ratable across those years. Is that still the view or is there -- is it going to ramp during that period? ."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Steely Yeah. So, as you said, the Q2 is still good. We have 757 behind us. I've given you the outlook for this year, so it's about 1-1 and that leads to what last over the last three years. So strict to pick map would be about $700 million. We do have a next year, as I mentioned, we have to pay back the fica payments, so that's $66 million. We have progress payments that have to be paid back, that's $100 -- around $160, so you can do some math on that, but there is a ramp to it. So, between those 2 payments and just a slight ramp, I mean, you can just model those 3 years out, but we still feel comfortable and it's appropriate to guide to $3.2 billion over these 5 years."
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Noah Poponak Tom. With these outsides of the normal course of business items, supply-chain, with just their material labor. And then also combining that with the, with how the growth compares shakeout. Should we be seeing thinking of next year? the shipbuilding growth rate being fairly back-end loaded versus the first-half? And then just following up on that Alion discussion there, are you seeing -- we've seen those headwinds across hardware and outside of hardware. Are you seeing some of those same challenges outside of the business in Alion or not as much?"
4465513,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s",HII,11/4/2021,CEO Mike Petters on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Steely Sure. For the first part, from a shipbuilding perspective, I highlighted a little bit earlier, I didn't hit the backlog piece of the outlook, right? So, unlike say, requiring needed new awards or funding, we have a line of sight of the work that we have in-house. So, I look at, from an outlook perspective, from shipbuilding. Still the 3% CAGR is good. I would tell you that although it looks like we're at the same point we were through the first 3 quarters of this year compared to last year, last year was an exceptional year, '18 to '19 with the 6% growth and then '19 to '20 with another 6% growth. And even specifically Q4 last year was a 19% growth over the quarter previously there. So, some material as I highlighted -- as actually Chris has moved into the end of Q4 of 2020, it made that year look big, which now makes 2021 look flat. So, I'm not concerned right now because we have the backlog, we have the work, we have the labor force right now. We are watching materials as I said and we're watching if the EO mandate impacts our workforce, but I don't -- I'm not concerned with how 2021 was shaking out from a revenue perspective. And I would think going forward that it's pretty linearly in 2022 for ship building. Relative to your lying question, I don't see obviously, their contracts are different, more service oriented. We're excited with them on board. Andy has put his leadership team in play, as Chris had mentioned earlier, the initial assessments that we had going into the purchase and now the close we've had a good 6 weeks run rate in the financials and look under the hood there. We're comfortable with what's in front of them. The items that they're bidding, and how they're executing on the existing contracts for evaluating the revenue synergies between Alion making us better, the DFS and MDIF and vice versa. So, I feel comfortable with that going forward there. I don't see today, again, the EL mandate significantly impacting our revenue expectations from an Alion perspective. We have highlighted from a [Indiscernible] perspective. When you get to watch the funding come about and the unmanned portfolio evolve and grow going forward. Special watch on for us."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stanley Elliott , everyone.  all for taking the question. Tom, I wonder if I could start off talking a little bit more about the pricing expectations for '22. Your very positive commentary about conversations, and then the comment about at least 5%?  so much."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill Yes, . Daily is -- as I look forward, I think this is one of the most important themes. As we've said, over the past couple of quarters, the combination of visibility to growing demand, you couple that with inflationary pressures. This all bodes really good -- bodes well for aggregate prices. And our teams recognized us wholly-owned and started trying to move price in Q2. And as we predicted, our third quarter price increases were 3.1 mix just 3.5, which was up sequentially from 2.6 in Q2 and 1.3 in Q1. And that sequential improvement is really important because it illustrates the improving pricing environment. So, looking forward, I would expect that trend to continue in Q4. And then looking past that at 2022, I think we'll see bigger jumps in pricing in January and in April as the 2022 fixed prices go into effect. So, as we said before, based on trends, backlogs, and customer conversations, I'd be very surprised if our 2022 price increases don't eclipse 5%."

4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Trey Grooms Tom and Suzanne, my question is looking into next year as well. You mentioned solid fundamentals, positive demand trends. But you also noted labor constraints which have obviously been a challenge for everyone. But taken all those things into consideration as you look at the geographies and the end markets that you serve, can you -- could you dive in a little bit more around how you're thinking about the volume outlook for '22 and maybe some of the key drivers there? ."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill Let's look present and then we'll look backwards into the quarter and then we'll look forward. So, on same-store basis, volume was up north of 5%, which was strong. The vast majority of our markets experienced volume growth, which speaks to the market 's underlying growing demand and how broad based it is. We'd have a little bit of weather in Alabama, parts of Texas, Arizona really got washed out. A little bit of weather in Northern California. Now, this -- but this was more than offset with really strong shipments in the Southeast and the Eastern seaboard. As we look to 2022, 2022 may be the first year in well over a decade where we'll see growth in all 4 end users. So, it's just broad-based. Residential construction should continue to grow, non-res, it's just very important because it continues to -- we're continuing to cope through the pandemic and moves into growth into 2022. Non-power infrastructure, we think grows following the big residential growth we've seen this year and how we demand in 2022, we'll also see growth supported by improvements in state funding and some COVID relief funds. So, all that's really good news for '22. Demand however, as we talked about the awesome headwinds, and you got supply chain issues, labor shortages in the beginning that have some impact on shipments. Now, those headwinds don't make demand go away, they only push it out and extend -- it really extends the cycle if that happens. So, the fundamentals for volume growth in 2022 are in place with some headwinds. And while it's kind of early in our planning stages under the conditions, I'd be surprised if we saw our growth above 4%. At the same time, that demand -- if we did have those headwinds, demand gets drawn out and extends the cycle, and with our ability to compound margins over time, that could be very helpful. So, fundamentals are really strong -- some dampening effect with supply chain and labor. But the underlying fundamentals are really good."

4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Stevenson In the press release, you mentioned that Concrete same-store sales volumes were negatively impacted by a fewer larger projects. I'm just wondering if you could provide any more color on this and how does the U.S. Concrete look from a comp standpoint? Are they running the risk of fewer larger projects unless lumpy volumes? Any more color would be helpful."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill Sure. The large projects we have finished up, we're in Northern Virginia, in the DC area, and it's just a little bit of a low in our in our backlog as we move into 2022. I think the underlying piece of Concrete improvement with the non-res piece. We see non-res growing in 2022. That's very important for ready-mix. The other thing I was encouraged within the quarter on the same-store basis and also with U.S. Concrete, you're starting to see unit margin expansion. And earlier in the year, both our Concrete business and U.S. Concrete's Concrete business got dinged from diesel and combination of diesel and what I'd call traffic inefficiencies. Last year, we just didn't have any traffic on the road so we were able to deliver concrete very effectively and efficiently. This year, not so much, and so it added some costs. While those were headwinds for '21 pricing at this point has jumped past that. It jumped past raw materials and we're seeing margin growth. So, as we move into '22 with the combined businesses, our predict, you will see volume growth really driven by non-residential construction growth, but also unit margin growth because prices have caught up in the past, cost changes from 2021. So, I'm very encouraged for our outlook in 2022 in this product line."

4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill Sure. So, the pipeline, as you would expect, is a lot out there. It's not all created equal and will be, as we always are disciplined about our M&A opportunities, we'll be disciplined about the markets we want to be in, what synergies are unique to Vulcan. And then we got to be disciplined on the multiple or the amount you're willing to pay. And then once you get it integrated fast and accurately -- we got question earlier, do we have capacity? Yes, I would expect us to do some the size of U.S. Concrete, but more traditional bolt-on size deals, we'd be interested in are working on a number of them."

4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Pettinari . I'm just wondering how the margin profile of the U.S. Concrete aggregates assets compares versus the Company average, as well as maybe same question on Concrete. And then is there a possibility or timeline for normalizing that difference, if any, if you could just talk about margin profile."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill So, their -- if you look at their aggregate unit margins, they're very respectable. They're probably a quarter less than ours. And so comparable, I think that they've done a good job with that. Their position in the markets are good, their structure of their markets is good, and it's very attractive. While they've done a really good job with that, I think that our -- and this is one of the important pieces of synergies, I think that our 4 strategic disciplines are very applicable to their business, to their aggregates business. We've already started on that. The teams have met and that's working. So, I think that as we work into 2022, the same applies both from a pricing and a demand and a unit margin growth perspective look into 2022. And we think that we can help them take steps and just like they can in Concrete. Moving to ready-mixed, I think that they are operating disciplines and  efficiencies are better than ours. They have some really impressive technology and where's my Concrete? The teams have already started applying that to our ready-mixed operations. And so, I think this is very helpful for both product lines that their technology and disciplines help us. Ourselves lives in aggregates and so that was one of the strengths of the deal."

If we could just maybe follow up on the comments on U.S. Concrete. I think you have laid out a $50 million run rate synergies by mid-year and next year with more details to come in February. But can you just help us understand, are you thinking about that being primarily revenue driven from additional aggregate sales or is this more going to come from some of those operational cost focus measures that you talked about. But just when we're thinking about integrating that in, help us think about that. If that's more on the top line or the cost."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill Yeah. We will be back in February with more details, but the symbiosis between the 2 companies, from my perspective, is appearing better than we originally thought. I had -- I'll give you some concrete examples. I had the opportunity a couple of 3 weeks ago to sit down with the combined Texas team, and was really impressed and very pleased with their focused, creative, and insightful combination of business -- combined business plans, to leverage commercial opportunities so they can improve price and volume. And their detailed plans and improving the operational execution. And we've seen the -- we're seeing the same thing with the California and Virginia teams. So, in all markets, stronger market presence, pricing, and logistics capabilities. And you've got a bit of a much better opportunity to leverage procurement opportunities. And as I said earlier, we're -- we have the ability now to use our technology and theirs to improve both the ready-mix concrete and the aggregate product lines in the -- for the for the two companies. So, it's -- for me it's just exciting to watch."

Could you just clarify the puts and takes for cost controls in the quarter around that? ."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Suzanne Wood I just want to add one point of clarification on the unit cost of sales increase on the same-store basis. They were up 1.7% as compared to last year's third quarter. But excluding diesel, they decreased almost 1%, and those numbers are in the press release."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill . We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer, Thompson Davis."

4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Adam Thalhimer Can you comment a little bit on the outlook for downstream margins?
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill So, if you look at Asphalt first, we took a big hit this year with liquid. And it's kind of -- you're a little bit comparing the perfect storm because last year, liquid prices plummeted and the margins went up. This year, they spiked and it took a bite out of margins. As we said in the prepared remarks, 2022 should see strong demand from improved highway work, and Asphalt prices are moving to catch liquid and you saw that start to move in the quarter. But there is a lag. So, we should see gross profit improvements in Asphalt in 2022, but I would not expect them to get back to 2020 levels. the reason why, is we had that big decrease in liquid in 2022. But I would expect profitability in the product line to improve based on volume improvements and unit margin improvements because prices are going up to catch liquid costs. Move into ready-mix, I think 2022 is set up very nicely for the combined Vulcan U.S. Concrete ready-mix businesses. And again, that non-residential demand turning to growth in 2022 is very healthy for concrete demand. Northern California saw some headwinds in '21, it's really hangover from the pandemic. It was the most severe shelter in place. And the government offices shut down so nobody could get building permits. And that air pocket is what hit us in 2021, we're past that. The permits are out there. Our backlogs are very good and growing, the same can be applied to New York exactly the same thing. And then Texas, it was good and we'll continue to grow. But the -- you couple all that with healthy pricing, price increases, which has now gotten into margin growth. I would really look forward to the 2022 Concrete business."

Just a quick question on Asphalt, you've highlighted some of the issues and the quarter. I guess my question is on pricing. It seems like it would've been slated Morgan, given the whole market, isn't anything that you can talk about the path through an Asphalt and any endurance is there and any details would be very helpful."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill Yeah, is this always a lag, you do have -- when you have spikes in an asphalt, you take a hit for a little bit of time until prices catch up. Again, like we saw in last year when it falls, the opposite happens and you're able to put those margins in your pocket for a well. So, liquid -- I think we'll settle down with that. We'll be able to catch it with price you sell that go up $2 in the quarter and will continue to accelerate. But it just takes time to catch up and I don't think we'll catch it all from '20 to 2022, but 2022 will be improved."

4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Macgregor Yeah. . I guess you've made repeated reference here to the same-store freight adjusted unit cost of sales excluding diesel, being down 1%. I'm guessing most of that would be  volume leverage. So, just how should we think about the margin benefit of the improved legacy operating efficiencies and productivity you achieved through the pandemic period? And do you expect to cover next year's cost inflation with pricing, or are you expecting productivity to play a more significant role in the '22 margin progression story? ."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill If you look forward to 2022 obviously, prices north to 5%, that's really good and will definitely improve unit margins. We know our goal every year is through efficiencies and disciplines to offset any kind of headwinds we have in price. We've done a really good -- that operate has done a really good job with that this year, obviously, we couldn't overcome diesel, but price did. I don't think that you see the big spikes like we had with costs in diesel going forward, so for sure, price, you will see margin growth in 2022. But it's going to  be the combination of price and operating efficiencies because you just got to continue to improve those to offset it. I would tell you if I looked at things like tons per man hour or footprint through a plant or plant availability across our footprint, particularly our top 50 plants, which is the most of production. It's not just volume that's covered up costs, it's also those efficiencies are improving. And that's just good, smart hard work by our operators."

4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Timna Tanners Wanted to follow-up on the Q4 guidance in particular, if we could. If I take the midpoint of the new guidance versus the old guidance, it's effectively a $25 million increase as I understood it. But you also talked about, about a $50 million contribution I think from USCR. If I understood that wrong, please clarify. But wanted to just make sure I understood what's driving that change, what is happening in this fourth quarter with regard to maybe picking up some of that volume that you highlighted losing because of the weather? And if anything, you can share with us on the trend in October, that'd be . ."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Suzanne Wood With respect to your question on the guidance, you're spot on. There was a $25 million net change midpoint to -- previous midpoint to current midpoint. If you just take the middle of the U.S. Concrete guidance range, we gave that's 55, so that implies a $30 million reduction otherwise. And what you're seeing there is just the rollover of the energy costs -- the energy headwinds into the 4th quarter, that's our current expectation."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Suzanne Wood I mean, we typically don't comment on October, on the call. I mean, it's pretty early days here in terms of closing, but I would say as we normal would at this point if we had anything materially different to say we'd say that in a press release or otherwise. So really no commentary."

4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unknown Analyst Hey guys. Tom, the bottlenecks you alluded to limiting volume growth in 2022 to 4%. How much of that is tied to external dynamics versus how you're set up from a labor and production standpoint? And I guess bigger picture, do you see these issue is getting cleared out by 2023, and do you see a more pronounced acceleration of volumes?"
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill I think that, oh wait till when we call for 2023. I think it's not us. I think we've got the capacity and the firepower to produce a lot more than 4%. I think it's really an ability for number 1. To get product to market through truck drivers and truckers. Second, is our customers’ ability to get more employees and it's more to catch up as opposed to get work done. I think they get work done, but the ability if you have a week of rain and to catch that back up, now you don't have the crews to take out there for the next 2 weekends to do it because you're [Indiscernible] people too many hours, you don't have enough people in the crews. And then the last thing is with particularly in [Indiscernible], you're seeing Supply-chain issues. Windows or door knobs or there's all kinds of different things that -- and there's a whole -- you can read about them, there's a whole list of them. But as you talk to the big residential customers, they're having supply-chain issues, and you have to put that mix in there and that hits non-res also. So, I think that while the underlying demand structure is very good, as I said earlier, what's really important is it's widespread geographically, but it's also across all 4 end uses. And up until this year of -- a few up until 2022, we've always had one of those as a drag and I don't think we do in 2022. So, the fundamentals are there. I think you just have a little bit of a dampening effect with labor and supply cha in. But if that clears up, we could do better at this point with work to be done and we'll come back in February with very clear guidance and the thought process behind that. But at this point, I would I would govern it to 4."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill For Lemming. I will be over 4 -- we're not trying to give guidance at 4 at this point, but I don't think you'll get over 4. We'll go next to Josh Wilson with Raymond James."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Josh Wilson Just a few clarification on the modeling side, when you first announced the U.S. Concrete acquisition, you expected it to add a $190 million in EBITDA. Prior to synergies, is there been any revision to what the baseline is given recent trends?"
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill I think they experienced headwinds we talked about with the recover from the pandemic and Northern California and New York. Obviously, they had the inefficiency cost headwinds with traffic getting back on the road. And the energy cost as Suzanne mentioned. As I said earlier, I think the market and demand headwinds are behind us. The permitting is strong, the backlogs are strong. Work is happening in the 2 coastal markets that we had concerns about in '21. And really Importantly, at this point, price has moved past cost and showing growth in unit margin. And obviously like the rest of the construction material sector, they'll have price increases in -- all these markets will have price increases in ready-mix between January and April. I think '22 sets up really well for the Concrete business on the aggregates piece of it, much like ours. It's the same comments we said about 2022 with price and volume and cost would apply to the previous U.S. Concrete aggregates businesses."

Hey, Tom, I know it's been a short period of time since ownership USCR, but any change to your collective, go-to-market, or overall strategy in the market so you already overlap the business, I'm thinking particularly California and if it is too early, maybe you can just talk about what gets you excited about controlling the upstream capacity, and frankly, the downstream capacity you now have in that region because that all seems pretty attractive."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Hill Yeah, it sits very well. It's a little too early to call the detail, and we'd like to do that in February, we'll do that in February. But I think what, as I said earlier, what really gets me excited is Those teams in California, Texas, and Virginia, we're together within days of the closing. They knew each other well, they were big customer virus, so they had relationships and they had their strategies and their tactics to improve volume, price, and leverage operating efficiencies and share information and assets and equipment. Before -- they had it together before, we could go back and review and we're executing. So, it happened really fast, more to come. We'll put a lot of detail on that, but I'm very pleased with what those combined Lawn (ph) managers have already put in place and what -- how quickly and smoothly that's gone. I think they are coming out -- the culture is being so much like each other. And our previous relationship has helped us. And I think I underestimated the speed at which that would impact the line in businesses. So progressive [Indiscernible]  work."

And looking at the USC assets that the capitalizati on of those assets, do they need to be caught up? Is there any special opportunities that you're seeing early on there? And I'm assuming you're probably going to budget a little bit more for inflationary contractor issues that probably haven't seen in the last several years. ."
4465522,Vulcan Materials Company,VMC,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Hill on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Suzanne Wood You're right. Clearly, the prices of everything is going up across the board. And when we also there as well have some supply chain issues to manage. But I'll just touch on this year first and then comment on next year. You'll note we kept our CapEx guidance for 2021 the same. And that's really as a result of reviewing U.S. Concrete 's needs for the period of ownership. We were able to fold that within the guidance range that we had. So really no big issues there. As we look forward to next year. Typically, we will spend somewhere between $450 million, $475 million give or take. I wouldn't expect that t o be vastly different. We're obviously still in the early days, and in terms of putting together the 2 capital plans and the 2 budgets and having a really good look at that, but I haven't seen anything so far that makes me or us believe that we need to significantly pick up that capex guide."

And Chris, welcome to BD. I guess to start with on the fiscal 2022 guidance here. Maybe a little bit more clarity on what is being assumed for vaccine contribution. And I think you men tioned Alaris pump sales in line with fiscal 2021. Maybe clarify what those numbers are. And on the combo test, is that -- what sort of assumption should we have on ASP for the combo test because I was curious on your pricing comment for COVID in fiscal Q4?"
4465531,"Becton, Dickinson and Company's",BDX,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Polen on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Hickey , Tom. Vijay, . So yes, just to reiterate on the combo. Just to reiterate what Chris has said, right. So if you think about what's come back into the base business for FY 2022, we do expect that as we get into the flu season, the respiratory season for both BD Veritor, and for BD MAX, that these combination tests will be the sort of the go-to test, particularly for people who might be symptomatic. And people who are sort of saying, do I have flu, or do I have COVID. So we do expect that to be the combo test. The installed bases are there to support that testing. And we've put into the range for next year, an estimate of around $75 million to $100 million back into the base business. From a pricing perspective, we do expect it to be a premium price, over the traditional tests as we've indicated; we're just not sharing specific pricing at this time."
4465531,"Becton, Dickinson and Company's",BDX,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Polen on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vijay Kumar Understood. And Tom I think I heard Chris mention the goal is exciting fiscal 2024 operating margins to be above pre-pandemic levels, fiscal 2019 operating margins were 25.3%, so when you say above pre-pandemic, is that the target in -- is exiting fiscal 2024 are you expecting to be above 25.3% or is that the annual goal fiscal 2024 overall margins to be above 25.3%. Maybe just give us some broad strokes on what's the exit there is that Alaris coming back and then base business execution or something else that's being done?"
4465531,"Becton, Dickinson and Company's",BDX,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Polen on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bob Hopkins Well  and , and s. And, Chris, welcome. My one -- really only have one question or one topic I wanted to cover. And, Chris, this is probably for you because it seems like a key part of this call is your assumptions on the improvement in base business operating margins from 2021 to 2022. So, a couple of things, I'd love you to comment on Chris if okay. One is I'm struggling a little bit with how to think about the starting point because Q4 base business operating margins are obviously a lot lower than full-year 2021. So maybe help me understand what's the right starting point. And then, secondly, I'd love you to talk a little bit about, how much of that 200 basis point improvement in base business you're assuming for the full-year is gross margin and just what are your assumptions on pricing embedded in that? So there's a lot in there. That's my one question. But I would love you address those things and  very much."
4465531,"Becton, Dickinson and Company's",BDX,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Polen on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robbie Marcus . Nice quarter and s. Appreciate it. Maybe just on the diabetes spin you talked about higher than company margins. Is there any color you could add to how much, and will we have the Form-10 by the Analyst Day next week?"
4465531,"Becton, Dickinson and Company's",BDX,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Polen on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Chris DelOrefice Hey, Robbie. How are you doing? It's Chris. Yes, as we said, the Form-10 will be later this year. That will -- we don't anticipate that being out by next week. Look, it's a . It's premature to share. We have to wait until the Form 10 is out, there will be much more detail there. But I really think the more important dynamic here is, right, this is actually just a portfolio transaction, and there is going to be sort of a reset of margin. And by definition, we had shared that, it is accretive, there will be a reset of margin, but more importantly, it's been diluted to both growth and margin growth, top-line growth and margin growth. So it could be an acceleration from that. And as we get into Investor Day, we can certainly share more as it relates to kind of the longer term impact as it relates to margin. And what I just shared in terms of our longer term margin improvement goals. We still feel really good about where we're going to position margin over time, and all these efforts going against that. And lastly, I think just the value creation opportunity this creates, I talked about the cash infusion of multiple years we get that gives us additional flexibility to think through how to reinvest and utilize those -- that cash infusion we can talk more about that as well over time."
4465531,"Becton, Dickinson and Company's",BDX,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Polen on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robbie Marcus . Appreciate it. And then maybe just one other, you talked about doing seven acquisitions this year, $500 million total. How do we think about the contribution of those to revenues in 2021 and 2022? And where do you put M&A in terms of capital allocation priority? How do you view the market right now in terms of asset availability and valuations? It'd be  to get your take on that? ."
4465531,"Becton, Dickinson and Company's",BDX,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Polen on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Polen Yes. Robbie. This is Tom and . So we'll try not to share too much of the thunder from next week, but it's . And we'll get more into this, but we've spent about $500 million this year. If you look at the acquisitions that we made last year, think about over the last 20 months or so we've invested about $900 million, that drives about $100 million this year and $200 million next year roughly from those tuck-in M&As. So if you do the math, that's about a little under a five times what we're paying in terms of revenue that we're getting from those acquisitions next year. And as you know, that's good value that we're getting, and we're obviously performing above our cost of capital on those acquisitions. We're clearly at those levels of multiples that were being able to get those assets for, we're not buying growth, we're absolutely growing what we buy leveraging our channels, our global position, our manufacturing capabilities, et cetera to scale these assets in ways that we're uniquely positioned to do so. We'll also share with you next week, the mix of how those breakout into the amount of spend and acquisitions that are going towards kind of that durable core base portfolio that we have versus those more transformative solution areas that I've talked about. Those three categories that we discussed and you'll see the weighting of those. They're highly weighted in high growth markets. That revenue that I described is growing north of double-digits as we go-forward. We continue to see opportunities. As we look ahead, we have a robust funnel. You can expect us to continue to drive that strategy forward. Obviously, it's been important part of why we focus so heavily on cash flow. Actually, if you look at our cash flow over the last two years since 2019, it's grown a t 18% CAGR. That's not by accident, we've had very focused programs driving that that's something we're very proud of. And it positions us, as Chris mentioned, to drive a balanced strategy between tuck-in M&A strategy to drive our growth, as well as continue to return value to shareholders, as you've seen us doing so. , Robbie and looking forward to more discussion next week."
4465531,"Becton, Dickinson and Company's",BDX,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Polen on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Robbie Marcus . Maybe just to clarify is there any revenues associated with the deals we should be thinking about in the model for next year?

First, how should we be thinking about the return on the $200 million of investments you guys made from the bolus of COVID testing? And when you'd expect to see some of those happening. And then just were those really one-time costs or successful programs, maybe just folding into more traditional M&A at this point?"
4465531,"Becton, Dickinson and Company's",BDX,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Polen on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Polen Yes, Matthew, this is Tom, . The -- . We are not that that spend is done, right. So we're not that's not recurring spend, as we've always communicated that got cutoff last year in Q4. So that is out of our P&L going forward. And we'll share more details actually about exactly where that money was spent. And you'll see throughout the discussions next week at our Investor Day, each of the different businesses highlighting the programs that they've invested in and you'll see how that help to accelerate our growth outlook as we go-forward over the long-term. It is mixed across both innovation as well as accelerating our simplification strategy as well, and we'll share more details on that next week. But there it is balanced across both of those categories. And when we say the growth agenda, how it's balanced on that side, it is majority of the growth money that we're spending is in R&D, but there is money that we spend on expanding channels, so specifically telesales in Europe, non-acute sales channels in the U.S., and you'll hear more about those specific investments from our leaders in the U.S. region and from our European leaders next week as well. And we're excited to be able to share that. I know there's been a -- we've been busy over this last year. We're really proud of the progress that we've made on our strategy.

So one question for Chris, one question for Tom, I'll ask them both now. Chris, maybe I'll ask Bob's question a different way. Can you talk a little bit about the margin in EPS cadence in fiscal 2022, how much below the operating -- the base operating margin of about 23.7%, you expect Q1 to be is 100 basis points, the right way to think about it. And consensus is I think 2.84 for EPS right now. I'd love to get your reaction to that, just to calibrate it correctly to start the year. And, Tom you guys are doing really well in China. There are a lot of investor concerns about multinational companies' ability to continue to grow there, given the value-based purchasing and the recent document 551. How are you feeling about your ability to continue to grow strongly in China and any reaction to some of those initiatives? s guys."

Just have one, sorry to keep focusing on the margin progression here, but wanted to better understand the impact in fiscal 2021. And then how to think about the impact in fiscal 2022 of China value-based pricing. I felt like that was a bucket that was called out on the third quarter call as a big headwind for margin and this year. I just wanted to understand better the impact this year and whether that with all the positive momentum you're experiencing, whether that turns into a margin tailwind in fiscal 2022. ."

So just wanted to ask two questions that are kind of related. Just conceptually when you gave us the update in the $12 floor a few months ago, could you just talk about, what's changed to give you the confidence to now put out the guidance in the mid-$12 range, and how things have developed here over the last couple of months?"

I just was going to turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for any closing remarks. I just  everyone for the good discussion today. We obviously are really looking forward to discussing all the  work that the team has been doing here over the l ast 20 plus months as we've been advancing our BD 2025 strategy. I personally I'm really excited to -- for next week's event. We're going to be able to share with you where we've been investing, how we've been refining, and making significant changes in our portfolio to optimize growth and margins. And you'll hear from a wide range of leaders on how they're executing and bringing to life our 2025 strategy to create value for our customers and shareholders next week. So everyone stay well, and we'll look forward to continue  dialogue next week. . . And that does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time.

George, perhaps I could ask you about the costims. We've been wondering when we're going to see the first data for the CD28 costims. Could you clarify exactly what we should expect to see next year? And from which combinations? And then just related to that, just these coming up, and there's a lot of discussion about 4-1BB. Could you clarify why you chose to pursue CD28 for your costims rather than 4-1BB?"

I know the ink is hardly even dry, I guess, on some of the prescription drug pricing framework negotiations and the write-up that's a company that from Congress. But this is something I'm sure you guys are watching closely. And obviously, any changes to Medicare Part B is potentially impactful to your business. Just any thoughts here on the impact to EYLEA, especially when considering the cap on out-of-pocket spending that's been proposed and discussed?"

Really just a quick one actually on the pozelimab and cemdisiran combo. I'd already mentioned some potential combo treatment studies, PNH and MG. Again, some of the other C5s, really kind of wanted to ask a little bit about how you're thinking about real-world use of this one. I know there's a lot of movement in -- especially the MG space. Is this something that we should expect to compete maybe more with Soliris? Or are you thinking a little bit further up the line against IVIG or some of the FcRns?

I wanted to ask on REGN14256, I guess, the new running partner for imdevimab. And if development was really in response to a specific shift you're seeing in the variants or lower efficacy? Or if you were looking to optimize on other domains? And I guess, in responding to that, could you also address kind of your expectations for running studies, conducting studies with a, I guess, a lower bac kground rate of hospitalization?"

Maybe for my question, I have actually really admired your BD strategy, which shows a lot of awareness recognizing areas of expertise, but also limitations and looking to be in partnerships and licensing to outsource the latter. I was wondering what you're really interested now on the BD front, if there are any technologies that are jumping out as additional areas of opportunity for the company? And then sort of partial to that, whether you are at all interested in this newly emerging field of protein degradation and protein degraders, as Oncology targets?"

Will it be in 2022 or 2023? And then with this full additional company, should we expect the R&D cost to continue to rise roughly at the rate they've historically been?"

I guess the first question I'd ask is in the event that they'll be hosting next year, in the first quarter, how much durability data might we get for TTR? And then, George, you mentioned the additional indication over the next few years that you'll be going into. When are we going to be hearing about those, would we hear about a lot of them in the beginning of the year or would we hear about them over the course of the year, I know Intellia is of huge investor interest as well as mine."

4465532,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",REGN,11/4/2021,CEO Leonard Schleifer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Yancopoulos Yes, we're not going to say too much about your first question. But in terms of your second question, absolutely. And so when we establish this relationship with Alnylam in terms of using siRNA, it was actually directed towards 3 separate areas. So really was 3 separate collaborations. The one in the first that we thought that we'd be moving the most rapidly into the clinic and that has turned out to be the case were with liver targets, both sort of more conventional targets like the C5, but also targets that were coming from our own pipeline like the HSD target that we talked about. And that -- those are all moving along forward and we think a very exciting fashion as we've discussed. Another key area that you just opened up, which is still preclinically, but we're hoping to eventually move into the clinic is targeting the eye targets with siRNAs. And that's really a very important area for us, and it was a very important separate part of the entire Alnylam collaboration. And the third really critical foundational part of our collaboration with Alnylam involved using siRNAs to target in the brain. And that's also moving forward in a very exciting fashion, and we'll be talking a lot more about that going forward. So really, it's a 3 sort of pillar program, liver targets, eye targets and CNS targets. We're very excited and moving forward on all of them. And as we had guided early on, the first set of targets, of course, would be in the liver and then we'd be moving into the other 2 areas as rapidly as possible. . , everyone. That will conclude our call. Bob Landry and the IR team will be available today to answer any additional questions you may have. , everyone, and stay safe. Goodbye. This concludes today's conference call.  for participating, and you may now disconnect."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Hey, . So just to kick things off real quickly, I understand the markets are dynamic and turbulent here. Can you just walk through a little bit more on the coal supply chain basically. And when are you expecting this to resolve itself? And more specifically, how much of this is realized versus unrealized? I just want to understand really the level of further exposure that could exist here as you think about your level of confidence in getting the supplies that you are anticipating to get, if you will?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Yes, Julien. So let me start by – we’ve all seen and experienced a pretty solid increase in natural gas prices. So when natural gas prices move up, where coal-generation flexes up and that caused a stress in the coal supply chain because I mean, we have been, for the past four or five years, generating at a certain level, not only us, but the entire coal-generation industry. So when you rapidly flex up, your coal supply chain doesn't flex up as quickly as you would like it to be, whether it's the commodity, the delivery, which is rail or chemicals, which is to control the emissions. Now, when that happens, in a normal circumstance, we will use that incremental generation to serve our month-to-month customers that are on their variable pricing. Now, when we are constrained, when we cannot flex up because of the supply constraints, then we have to go-to-market and procure at higher prices, which means then we have to make a decision, how much of these higher cost we pass through our customers. Keep in mind that we are balancing here margin stability and retention. So -- and one of the objectives that we have when we see these sudden increases -- short-term sudden increases, we don't want to cause a bill shock to our customers. We want to make sure that we maintain that we pass some of the cost, but not all of the cost. Obviously in the mid and the long-term, you can pass all the costs. But in the short-term, you really want to avoid bill shocks because if you lose the customer, you're also going to spend money in acquiring back the customer. So that's why this is a very deliberate, this is a balancing act between margin and stability and retention. Now, in terms of the duration of these, I expect these to be primarily in the first-half of the year. I think this will ease off in the second half because supply chain and the coal supply chain will respond to increasing pricing levels. Now to your question around realized and unrealized, most of these right now is on realized, but - because these are month-to-month customers. So, we have some levers to mitigate the impact. I mean, the first one is, obviously, how do we optimize our coal generation? Should we be looking only at running when you have really high-margin hours and then backing down in low-margin hours? We are in constant communication and testing the market in terms of our retail pricing strategy and priorities. I mean, the other leverage, Direct Energy synergies, and we're going to continue looking at if we can expand those Direct Energy synergies. And then finally, as you mentioned, I mean, this is a very evolving story, so things can change fairly quickly, just like the entire system moved up in the back of natural gas. It can come back down to more normal levels, and therefore, this will -- these constraints will ease, and we'll be back to a more normalized, I guess, environment. So I hope that these provides you that that framework and that explanation on what we're seeing today."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jul ien Dumoulin-Smith Excellent. And just to be clear about this, basically, it was more about the gas price increasing and you wanting to ramp per coal-to-gas switching, your coal gen, such that when you think about the existing commitment that you had on rail, et cetera, those remain intact here, if you will, coming into this fall season and into next year. And also, if I can throw out just the third question super quickly, can you just reaffirm here your expectations on '23? And otherwise I think I heard that already in the commentary, just want to make sure, we're crystal clear on the transient nature of these factors here, especially against your '23?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Absolutely. And I think that's what – that’s how we wanted to lay it out for all of you. I mean, there - we think of this as transitory, specifically for 2022, both some of these supply chain plus the outage in Limestone, I expect that to normalize in 2023 and that's why we wanted to provide you the earnings power of our platform on a – in a normalized basis ‘23 and beyond."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Lapides Hey, guys. Just curious you talked about a lot of these things being kind of abnormal or one-off items. As you think about the opportunity set for investing capital, would you be willing to push out the date you get to the 2.25 to 2.75 net debt to EBITDA to use capital for either a gross initiatives that generates a really high return or to use it to repurchase equity, which may generate  an equally higher or even higher return? How do you evaluate when the market gives you opportunities that may be transient in nature about the timing of wanting to do debt pay down versus the timing of other more accretive investments?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Yes, Michael, I mean, we're always have to be flexible and aware of the opportunities that we have, right? I mean, we cannot be tone-deaf to what is happening around the organization around our markets. I believe that the value proposition of NRG, it is this balance approach of maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning capital to shareholders and growing the Company now. And that we have a tremendous opportunity on growing into these customer service or consumer service opportunities that we see in the market. So we're very, very excited about that. Now, having said that, I expect 2022 to perhaps be a little bit lighter on the investing in growth as opposed to '23, '24, and '25. What that means is, the business -- our business that is generating tremendous excess cash over $1.6 billion. We're going to be using our capital allocation principles, which is going to be returning capital to shareholders and growing. But since we're going to be only deploying, I would say a smaller part in 2022, I think, you should expect our share of returning capital to be bigger than the 50% that we have indicated in the past. So that's how I would think about it. Now, we continue -- we remain committed to our 2.5 to 2.75 by 2023 and we expect what achieve that through growing our EBITDA. And we grow the EBITDA by executing on the Direct Energy synergies and now with the incremental growth EBITDA that we can generate. So that's how I would frame it. Michael, obviously, we'll remain flexible, we'll remain opportunistic and we are not going to be tone-deaf to what we -- the opportunities that we will see in the market."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Michael Lapides Got it. How do you think about for 2022 cash available for allocation? About when you would make the decisions on the other 50%.
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Well, I mean our plan would be to provide you a lot more clarity in the next earnings call. We would have that point. Identify what goes to growth investments and what we're going to do to return capital to shareholders. But I think -- I hope that the number that we provided you today. Gives you have a pretty good idea in terms of the magnitude of the excess cash that we have and where are we leaning and where do we see the opportunities to create value. I have said in the past, I believe that buying back our shares at discount creates value for our shareholders. Since I took over as CEO, we have bought back close to 25% of all the shares outstanding. So this is something that we're going to continue doing, is part of our value proposition, and we're going to remain opportunistic about it."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Lapides Got it. And hey, last question I'll be quick here. Just curious when the Board, and we can look at the various financial metrics in the proxy that outline with the goals of the Company. But just curious when you have conversations with the Board, what tends to be most important, EBITDA growth, free cash flow per share growth, or is there another metric we should think about?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Well, Michael, I will tell you. It's always free cash flow per share growth because that's what matters to our shareholders. The per-share metrics, and we've outlined a 15% to 20% free cash flow per share growth in our 5-year plan. I think that's very, very compelling. We have the excess cash to execute on that both in terms of growing the numerator and then reducing the denominator while maintaining a strong Balance Sheet. So I think this balanced approach serves us well in the long run. Perhaps in the short-term, there may be other things that people want to do but I'm looking at long term value creation for our shareholders here."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shahriar Pourreza Well, sorry to sort of beat on this a little bit, but I just want to get a bit of a stronger sense and I'm still getting questions here on it. The '22 guidance walk is the normalized '22 EBITDA before transitory cost kind of a fair run rate target, as we're thinking about future years and sort of the significant coal supply chain cost, can they be mitigate d if this isn't a short-term headwind? I mean, why assume this is transitory, especially if the gas curve has longevity? And then, the Texas ancillary service charges in bucket 2, what are those exactly again?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez And now, Shahriar, just to be still to be clear. Some of these ancillary costs that preceded describing a lot of them, we pass them through already, our customers, some of them we -- like I said, we don't want to create a bill shock. So in the medium to long run, all of these ancillaries will be passed through to customers. But in the short-term, we're managing these bill shock versus stability of margin and our retention numbers, just keep that in mind. That's why I call this transitory."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Mauricio Gutierrez And over the medium to long run they all make it -- to pass it out.
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shahriar Pourreza And then, just lastly, you added 500 megawatts of PPAs in ERCOT last quarter. Can you maybe just unpack this a little bit? What's behind this? What are you seeing in the market right now? And more importantly, does some of these input cost pressures in specifically the renewable space, could that potentially impact your future PPA opportunities? , guys."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Yes, once again, I think that's in short term. We are seeing some supply chain issues in the solar, particularly in solar. We are going to be constantly in the market running RSPs to get solar wind and we are actually now looking at batteries. They continue to be very attractive from an economic standpoint. We are probably taking off our feet from the pedal just because it's -- we are aware of the supply chain, so we are slowing down a little bit on these PPAs. We want to see how these works out and then re-engage. I think that's the prudent thing to do. I'm very pleased with where we are today in terms of the PPAs that we have been able to sign and the economics that we have been able to achieve. But I also recognize that there is a transitory issue right now with supply chain that I don't want to be signing PPA's at higher costs. We've been very disciplined in terms of where we actually execute these PPAs. So my expectation is it has slowed down over the past couple of months, I think it's going to continue like that. And we're going to start picking up when we start seeing these supply chain issues ease off a little bit."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shahriar Pourreza . , guys. I'll stop there. Appreciate it."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Steve Fleishman Another [Indiscernible] in cost as gas prices which is also lifting up power prices and you don't mention that as a pressure in '22. Is that something that you feel like you're able to pass along to customers essentially or is that also kind -- because there is some lag and things and everything like how much is that additional pressure?
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez cause a bill shock to our customers, at the same time you want to manage stable margins and good retention numbers, which are very, very compelling on our business. So that's how I'm thinking about it and that's why -- I mean, if it's a structurally higher gas prices, I don't have a big issue with that. I mean, the issue it always comes when gas prices move up very, very quickly. And then you have these constraints on the coal supply chain, and that's what we are addressing these here as transitory."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman Okay. And then just more explicitly asking, I think what others maybe were earlier. The -- obviously when you look at debt to EBITDA targets, EBITDA is lower. It affect meaningfully where you are. Just this '22 EBITDA guidance. Are you going to be targeting off of that or are you just going to say this is not normal and we're just going to ignore it?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez I think you need to recognize that '22 is a transition year and our commitment is achieving this in 2023, which we expect to go back to our normalized earnings. So when you're thinking about our trajectory from where we are today to how we get to 2023, you always have to take into consideration this on anticipated issue that we're seeing on the supply chain. So we remain committed for 2023. We believe that we can get to those credit metrics by growing into them now, not only Direct Energy synergies, but also additional growth EBITDA that we can execute on. And that's how I think about it. So I wouldn't read too much into the number in 2022. I think what is important is our objective in 2023."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Angie Storozynski . I wanted to start with a question about buybacks. And they need to support the stock clarity. Okay. Well, I understand that the Board usually makes those decisions in the fourth quarter. Well, I'll argue that given today's updates, an earlier decision would have been badly needed. Your peer made some unique decisions on that front. You guys -- seems like most of the money that would go to buybacks is not going to materialize anytime soon, and again, there is a need to support the stock. So would you be open to some unorthodox solutions here to again accelerate the buybacks either -- I don't know, either use revolver or something else to just support the stock now?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Well, as I said Angie, the first thing is I think the value proposition of NRG has always been this balanced approach between a strong Balance Sheet, returning capital and growing. So what you're describing is basically levering up to buy back stock. And at this point that's not our focus. Our focus is on continued executing on this balanced approach. But like I said, we are generating tremendous excess cash in the next 13 months. We're going to be deploying that consistently with our target allocation principles. That already gives you an indication. I described as the floor on share buybacks because you can clearly see the $1.6 billion of excess cash. You can look at -- if that's a 50/50, then you know what the dividend number is. You can be confident that the share buybacks that gets us to the 50%, that's -- you should think of that as the floor. And then on the opportunistic deployment of the other 50%, that's what we're talking about, right? That's what we're going to be flexing off. We want to be opportunistic about it. But I also want to I want to stay true to the value proposition that we have indicated to our shareholders. We're not going to become the FNG, and we're going to evaluate all the options that are available to us. And I think ou r record of execution should tell you that if there is a deep discount on our shares, we will react accordingly and we have done that in the past."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Angie Storozynski Okay. And then the second question. So my initial take when I read the press release, was that all of these issues that are weighing on that 2.3 to normalize EBITDA are related to generation. But really, if you listen to the discussion so far on this call, it seems like all of them are retail related. And again, I know that you're no longer differentiating between generation and retail but it seems like your pitch is an attempt to protect those retail margins when all of these charges that we're talking about should have been weighing the profitability of the retail book. And again, I understand you don't separate, but again, to me it just seems like there is a weakening of the profitability of that large retail book for various reasons, some of which you do not control. But I feel like you are attempting to make it seem like it's on the generation side when it seems like it's more on the retail side."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Well, Angie, it stems from the generation side because when you actually -- if we actually, in a normal circumstance, if our coal generation was able to flex off, we always plan to use that additional megawatts to cover our month-on-month customers. We don't have it and the market indicates that we should, but because we have these constraints, we cannot flex that off. We have to buy it as replacement cost. So I wouldn't characterize it as a retail thing. I think that's the -- I'm trying to connect the two so you understand the reason why this is happening. It stems from the generation side but if I actually had a heat rate call option on gas, I wouldn't be having this conversation. We would be able to flex up those megawatts and serve our month-to-month customers. So, I just want to be careful that I actually wouldn't characterize it as a retail concern. This is basically starts with an issue on coal supply that impacts our coal-generation economics which then impacts how we were thinking about managing those month-to-month customers than your pricing every month on a continuous basis."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Angie Storozynski So just one follow-up here because I guess if the -- I don't quite understand that the hedging strategy here, because I would have thought your -- you had your retail book using economic generation at the time of the hedge. And so in light of the higher power prices they economic generation from has in coal plants has increased. You don't really have many gas plants, so there's not much of a detriment. So there should be potential excess generation from the coal plans which -- okay, it's not materializing because you don't have access to incremental coal supplies, but why would it be a drag versus the initial hedge?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Well, because the month-to-month, you don't have an initial hedge on the month-to-month. You hedge against your fixed price low. And like I said, we are passing some of that cost, but not all of the cost. So on the month-to-month, because you have this desirable pricing, you have some but the extent that we have seen in terms of the increase in gas prices that impact power prices, really has put us in a position where we need to make a decision, do we want to pass through all of these at the expense of retention or not? But it all stems from the fact that we cannot flex up our coal generation because of these supply constraint issues."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Arnold Hi. A couple of things. Could you just give us a little more on what exactly happened at Limestone, what caused the extension and how confident are you that they will come back in April. And maybe quantify that what the impact in '21 has been, or is expected to be."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Christopher Moser Yes, Jonathan, this is Chris. In terms of what happened at Limestone, the duct that connects the back-end controls to the stack collapsed, and so we've gone through the demolition part of that, still finalizing root cause, but very close on that. And we are well underway on the restoration plan, which is expected to be done in April 15, right in the middle of April."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Mauricio Gutierrez It will be -- the plant will be available ahead of the summer.
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Jonathan Arnold Do you have business interruption what have you insurance on that -- these assumptions?
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Christopher Moser Yes, there's property damage and business interruption, but that will take a little while to work through right. But we notified them. They've been working through it with on the process as we've been going in terms of demolition and the reconstruction of it."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Arnold Okay. And then obviously, you mentioned you're confident that these pressures are going to moderate in the second half, is that what's assumed in the 100 million on Slide 8 or could that number increase if you don't see that moderation in the back half of the year?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Yes. So our number incorporates our expectation. What we're right now seeing and hearing from our railroad partners and coal suppliers So this is reflected in this number. Obviously, we're working hard to mitigate this and I already listed a few of the things that we're going to mitigate. We're going to be working harder. I'm not pleased with it and I don't want -- these are not realize, these are unrealized and as long as they're unrealized There is some opportunity to get back to normal number. And then if they, if it gets better, quicker than you can expect upside if it gets worse than we will try to mitigate things. I think we're getting ahead of it, we have a pretty good we believe in terms of how we can mitigate these for 2022. But yes, that's how I would characterize it."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Arnold Okay. And then finally, on this normalized '22 number, so we're trying to think about what that looks like. Beyond ' 22. We'd add incremental direct synergies, right?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez So we have about a $110 million in 2023 in addition to 2. [Indiscernible], I think that's what we -- and obviously, this is just another lever that we're working hard. I'm very pleased to see where we are on synergies year-to-date. But we're always going to be looking at additional opportunities to make our platform more efficient."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Arnold Okay. So 110 on top of the 2.32 that you would expect, and you're also hoping clearly exceed that?"
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez Correct. And then also keep in mind that you have the remaining of the PJM assets, which is about $40 million, a unit to the [Indiscernible] in order to complete their normalization of your exercise."
4465533,"NRG Energy, Inc.'s",NRG,11/4/2021,CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mauricio Gutierrez All right. . , Jon. It is all the time we have for questions. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'll now pass it to Mauricio Gutierrez for closing remarks. , Benjamin. Well, , everybody, for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to talking to you soon. . Ladies and gentlemen,  for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Zimmerman .  for taking the questions. Suky, I really appreciate the guidance for the fourth quarter. [Indiscernible] maybe $200 million or so ahead of where you're landing for the fourth quarter and the top-line $0.40 or so below consensus in terms of EPS line. And so, just I'd love to understand specifically where you see the est Delta, between your previous expectations from a product segment and recovery standpoint. It sounds like VBP is maybe 3/4 of that $200 million. But outside of that, where you see an impact that we should be thinking about from a guidance perspective."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Suky Upadhyay Yeah, so , Ryan. Absolutely, our Q4 implied is lower than where we were when we last provided guidance in August and updated in September. And if you remember that guidance is predicated on COVID not worsening and actually starting to see things recover and improve. And as we came into the third quarter, the early part of third quarter, we actually saw some positive momentum with some modest growth in the first two months. But then as we came into September, we saw -- while we saw elective procedures increase in September, as they generally do seasonally, that pressure from COVID and from staffing shortages was er than expected, such that the growth wasn't there; and we just didn't get to 2019 levels. So you really have to think about recalibrating the third quarter as then you move into the rest of the year because those much lower than we thought. And then our original guidance suggested that Q4 would be at about market growth or slightly better. That clearly is not what we saw in September and so what we're doing is we're taking that September trend, which was down, and we're carrying that forward into the fourth quarter. So that, I would say, is the largest component of our takedown for our rest of year guidance and for Q4 specifically. In addition to that, there's been some incremental ad ditional pressure due to VBP -- we had always assumed that there would be some inventory dynamics that we accounted for within our forward-looking guidance range. But what we're seeing now is slightly bigger impact primarily driven by this notion of we're seeing in-market, and from our local teams are telling us that patients are beginning to defer their procedures until the implementation so they can secure a lower out-of-pocket. So I would really pull back and say that the biggest component is due to that headwind due to COVID. And instead of the fourth quarter growing, as we originally thought, that pressure that we're seeing in September we're assuming that continues for the rest of the year and that really is your biggest deviation."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Zimmerman Okay. I appreciate that color and then just from a margin perspective, stick with you Suky. Longer-term margins -- you obviously talked about 30% adjusted operating margins. The street's assuming about 26.7% in '22, just given the dynamics today and the expectations, how does that sit with you today from that perspective, where consensus is at right now. What is your view of a normalized operating margin and call it a steady-state, normalized operating environment, because you do have some operating expenses and fluctuation as a result of some of these dynamics."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Suky Upadhyay Yes. , . So I'll try and unpack that. First of all, we see next year as a bridge year to that 30% operating margin. But I -- you really have to step back and there are a lot of moving parts into 2022. And I'll just try and break that down one-by-one and help give you some additional color. First of all, like I said about 3Q going into 4Q, as you think about '21 on to '22 you got to recalibrate the starting point, right? We're going to be on a lower revenue base because the pressure that we're projecting to see in the fourth quarter. And then from that, we would expect this COVID pressure to continue at least until the early part of '22, right? So revenue will be pressured. We believe in at least the early part of '22; that's one overarching assumption. And then margin largely follows revenue, especially for our Company from a leverage standpoint and the ability to get profit off of our fixed cost base. But from there, as we move into operating margin, there's a number of moving parts. I would say first inside of operating margin, you have gross margin. The way I've always talked about gross margin sort of in the mid-term is the take the second half of 2020 and kind of think about gross margins being stable from there. It could be slightly up or down in any given quarter, but largely stable to the back half of 20. We still think that that's the right starting point, but what we have to watch out for now is the impact of BVP, and what that does as a headwind. And also, what we're seeing like many of our peers in our sector is some inflationary pressure on cost of goods and input, costs and labor costs. So we're just got to watch those headwinds. Look, our teams are working really hard to help offset those. But that's still a moving target for us and something that we got to continue to put a little bit more rigor on, and obviously we will give more detail when we give guidance at the end of the 4th quarter. Then within operating margin as well, the 2nd key component is SG&A. I'm really proud of what the team has done already this year to respond to lower revenues and lower margins, because all the factors I talked about. And quite frankly, we're accelerating our transformation journey and we're doing that in a number of ways. 1. We're looking at regional profitability and we're looking at restructuring a number of markets that are just below where our expectations would be. We're looking at other areas of our cost base and accelerating our Global Business Services strategy. And there are other structural type initiatives that we're taking inside of SG&A to help some of those revenue and gross margin headwinds that I talked about. So those are some of the moving parts. I'm not going to get into exactly what '22 looks like yet. I think we got to let a lot more play out in the rest of this year, especially around COVID before we can give you a more detailed view of '22. But hopefully, you've gotten some good color there to help you start on '22."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Drew Ranieri Hi, Bryan and Suky. . I guess just to go off of the previous question, but more so on your long-range plan. Suky, you're mentioning that you're pulling forward some initiatives, but just how are you thinking about your long-range growth right now at margin targets. Maybe help us better understand if any of the composition has really changed in reaching that 30% operating margin. It's about a 400 basis points of expansion, it looks like. But any more that you can provide there?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson All of this obviously assumes that when we're in 2023, that COVID is in the rearview mirror and no longer a headwind, obviously."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Drew Ranieri . . And just as a follow-up, just on Persona IQ. Bryan, you just launched the product, but would love to get your initial feedback on what you're hearing in the field and maybe if you could set expectations of how a launch should progress over the next 12 months. I mean, would you be disappointed if it wasn't like 5% of your total Knee implants, but just any flavor would be helpful. ."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson So I'm kind of -- I'm looking at my COO right now across the table and I just gave him a new target of 5% to get IQ and [Indiscernible] implants. He is a little worried about that. But what I would tell you though, all tongue and cheek aside, we're very excited about IQ; this is the first of its kind. It's good to bring technology to the market that literally is new-to-market. And that's exactly what we have. And although we're excited about IQ by itself, it's a really important variable in a much broader equation which we call ZBEdge. Because now what we're focused on in ZBEdge is to be able to collect data before, during and after the procedure and is a really important reason for that, because as that data lake increases, what we're going to be able to do is to predict what kind of care we should provide for the patient. Here's what I know, every time I'm out talking to a surgeon, I don't care how good they are, or what their capability is. They always have a patient, patients that look perfect. They did all the right cuts. They have -- the image looks fantastic. The tissue balancing was perfect, but that patient is not happy. And they don't know why. I don't know why. But as we collect this data and again, the data later gets larger, we're going to be able to predict why and be able to change that outcome. That's the intent here. And why that's really important -- is because when we can do that, you got patients sitting on the sideline right now that would enter the funnel, but are afraid to because they don't believe they're going to get the satisfaction they're looking for. If we can change that paradigm, we can get more patients into the funnel. That's good for everybody in this base. So IQ is very attractive to us, but it's a part of a bigger equation. And I could tell you from IQ perspective, we're in a very limited launch. We want to learn as much as we can as fast as we can. We do have some supply constraints here. And that will put a little bit of a damper on how we're going to roll this out. Microchips are tough to come by. It's not impacting us in ROSA because you're talking in hundreds. When you move to IQ, you're talking thousands. And so it is going to get in the way, in the short-term that we're again -- we're trying to work through it, but that is going to put a damper on our launch. The demand is , there's a lot of noise around this and people are very interested, so that's a good sign. We've got to work through the supply constraints and move this forward, but overall, we're very happy."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Amit Hazan  and . I just want to maybe first to get a clarification on the China situation. I'd love a little bit more color on what you're thinking now in terms of your share within the China market going forward, but also whether you're contemplating spine and trauma in the new impact. And then perhaps most importantly, why would next year be a 100-basis-point impact given that you're already seeing pretty significant impact this year."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson I'll start with the impact. No matter what happens in this base year, we're still predicting a 1% shift to whatever revenue assumptions you've had in 2022. So if you look at growth rate from '21 to '22, that's going to change because you can have more in your base. But the actual impact to consolidate revenues is still 1% in '22. So that's why we're looking at it. And let's say 1% sounds like I know exactly, Just know there's still some variability here. Could be a little more, could be a little less, but I think the right way to model it is 1%. Remembering again that even though it's 1% of consolidated revenue, it's all in large joints. Okay. If I think about our share position in China, we look  -- I just give you a factoid. Just as an example, if you look at our Asia-Pacific 's, not specifically China, but gives you some context here. If you look at our Asia-Pacific Knee business -- the revenue that we do on an annual basis, i's bigger than all 3 of our major competitors' OUS Knee business. That gives you some sense for our market share inside of Asia-Pacific and inside of China. So this is a pretty important market for us. Here's what's  though when we think about share position going forward; even though it's not as an attractive market now because of the margin profile of the business in large joints, we won every one of the categories. There are eight categories. Number 1, it may be an unattractive space but you still got to win. And the first step in winning is you got to be in play. And we're in play in every one of the categories. We're the only multinational Company to do that. Number 2 now is going to be negotiating with distributors. So we get the best distributors to be able to get the most share at the best margin. And that's exactly wh at we're focused on right now. So that gives you a sense for how we're feeling about it. And when I think about trauma spine, it's too early. What I'd say on trauma, there's a provincial tender that just went through; its 12 provinces tender that we think [Indiscernible] at least hearing rumors could end up being a national tender, kind of transition to a national tender, but we don't have any sense for when that would occur. But anyway, that's our sense for China, our share position and [Indiscernible]."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Amit Hazan And then I want to focus on [Indiscernible] share with my second question. Just [Indiscernible] -- obviously important for investors. And I think that one of the things that investors have a harder time understanding now is just the fluctuations in share quarter-to-quarter, especially in the U.S. market. And so the question is really whether anything is changing in the way you sell the product. Is there more end-of-quarter selling? What is it that you're seeing or doing differently now that makes it more difficult for all of us to assess whether you're gaining share on a -- kind of consistent basis? I know, like you said, there's been more quarters of share gains than not in the last 6. But still investors are, I think, uncertain as to where that's going because of some of that fluctuations. So what can you do to help us understand what's happening on a quarterly basis that's changed in this COVID era?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson Well, what I would say is there's nothing that I would point out for us. I mean, we're conducting business the way we always have. My sense is probably everybody else's too. I think what's happening is just there's a lot of variability in the market because of COVID. You think about it, I mean, COVID is surging at different times in different states in the U.S. different cities in the U.S.. It all kind of depends on your mix in those states. And that's just looking at the U.S. is even broader than that and more volatile outside the U.S. So I think the challenge in seeing these individual quarters have these odd deltas between competitors is not necessarily because competitors are doing anything different. It's because the market dynamics are very different. That's why I continuously look at trends even in these turbulent times, the trend typically tell us a story because it neutralizing some of that variation. But I don't think it's anything that anybody is doing differently. I just think that the market is creating a much more challenging environment to look at consistency from Company to Company."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joanne Wuensch  and  for taking the questions. Just 2 in particular. The first one has to do with the month of October -- it sounds like you're taking September and applying that, but we have a whole other month of data in between -- is there anything you can share with us on how that is looking or how it looked?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson So what I'm -- without giving specifics, we haven't seen anything in October that we'd indicate that this logic that we're using is incorrect."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joanne Wuensch Okay. And then the other category which [Indiscernible] ROSA, could you share a little bit of color on how that launch is going in terms of utilization, halo effect to other products, competitive accounts, anything that flushes that out a bit would be appreciated. ."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson Yeah. You know, essentially because in these turbulent and challenging times, you always look for things that you're excited about. And our innovation pipeline is one that I'm very excited about, and at the center of that is ROSA. There's no question that we continue to deliver on our expectations there, if not above. And I will just go back to the design characteristics that we put into place. We've really took our time to make sure that we learned from who went first and we designed a robotic system that surgeons really wanted and that's translating into demand and that continues. The fact is, surgeons don't want to change the flow of their procedure. And we have created a robotic system that keeps it as close as possible to non-robotic procedure. We make [Indiscernible] time neutral to be able to use robotics at the same amount of time it would take to do a non-robotic procedure, including all the accuracy though involved in it. And we made sure that we didn't change the standard of care relative imaging. We don't have to CT scan, people don't use it otherwise and they can use the typical imaging that they would use for a procedure. All those things combined with the best implant that we have in Persona is what's driving traction right now. And we are absolutely seeing strong demand, which is continuing for us. We're seeing deeper penetration as a result of that into our accounts; in competitive accounts as well. And what's really important about that is with all these placements now in place, remember that pull-through that you're asking about the commitment of volume is being muted by COVID. So in the COVID, the [Indiscernible] has gone, those units that we have in place will actually increase their overall input and not just in the disposable price point that you have with robotic procedures, but also the pull-through of competitive business. So we're very excited about where we are with ROSA. We know that we've got the right design in place, and we're seeing  traction."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kyle Rose .  for taking the questions. Two for me as well. First on -- you talked a little bit about accelerating some of the transformation programs. Just wondering if you can maybe break that down a little bit more granularly. What specifically have you accelerated, and then maybe what costs do you expect to unlock over the course of the next 15 or 12-15 months?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson So . We're still in the planning phase of that and we'll have a lot more detail around that on our fourth quarter call as we come into 2022. But the key areas for us are really around, as I talked about earlier, accelerating our view of market profitability and regional profitability -- how we ultimately go to market, what's our infrastructure in a lot of our smaller markets and just making sure that investments are in fact aligned to growth and opportunity. So I would say that's one. The second area is we looked across our organization. We looked at how we're structured relative to benchmark and where we had outliers, where we had higher costs; we're looking to take actions to make ourselves more efficient, either through just restructuring and de -layering and/or accelerating moving resources to our highly capable Global Business Services that we have in lower-cost countries. So, those are probably the 2 key areas. I think the 3rd structural area we're looking at is continued consolidation of our ERP systems, which is going to give us a better global process orientation, which could yield savings over time. And then of course we're always actively looking at site rationalization to help with gross margin. And I'm really excited about where the team is moving with pricing improvements going forward. Again, we're going to provide more detail as those become more refined, both on the contribution but also the relative cost to those when we give our fourth quarter earnings."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kyle Rose .  and then maybe Bryan on maybe some of the bigger picture longer-term initiatives you talked about. I mean, you talked a lot of ZBEdge in my mobility and we've got Persona IQ and I understand that IQ is going to be a slower roll out, but maybe just help us understand where you are as far as commercialized in some of these initiatives that you talked about the long-term perspective. I'm just trying to really put some goalposts around expectations for investors as far as, when we'll actually start to see the materially impact your business and be a driver or a competitive differentiator."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson Yeah. I think you're already seeing some of this and the nice thing is we're just in the forefront of that innovation pipeline. Here's what's interesting. I think one of the most important things about that 5 quarters out of the last 6 where we've been above market in Knee, isn't necessarily the amount that we've been above-market or just even those 6 quarters. It's looking at the trend break that you're seeing from ZB -- and what do I mean by that -- if you go beyond those 6 quarters and you look at the 20+ quarters that ZB has been a Company, we did not have one quarter as a Company above-market in Knees -- not 1 quarter in more than 20 quarters. So that as a significant reflection of the transformation taking hold. And it's a reflection of the transformation taking hold when we're at the -- just the beginning of the innovation cycle. We're only about a mid-single-digit vitality index right now. Our strap plan would indicate that's going to triple over the strap plan period. That's a dramatic tailwind that we expect to see in our innovation pipeline which is a big part of why we believe this is sustainable. If you look at specifically in Knees and the execution is definitely better than we've seen before. Our compensation structure is now focused on growth rather than just maintaining business and our operating mechanisms are as good as I've ever seen. There's clearly no more supply issues anymore. It's all around innovation now. And innovation still drives from Persona Revision that is still getting conversions on the revision side. But most importantly now, i t gives you a beachhead with customers that are using our Revision System in somebody else's total Knee -- guaranteed we're going to be pursuing that total Knee business, and that's bigger than the revision business. You still have ROSA Knee that's just getting started. We've got a lot of headroom in ROSA Knee and that continues to pace very well. ROSA Partial just launched. Remember, at Partial, we have a very large share position. So even if we didn't get competitive business which we certainly are going to try, we have a mixed benefit associated with that in those partial procedures. Persona IQ just starting as we talked about before, and ZBEdge is exciting and then in 2022, we've got a new form factor for our Persona Cementless, which is going to remove all stops for us to be able to pursue a conversion to Cementless Knee. So all those things just give you a lot of shots on goal to continue to drive strong performance in Knee."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sam Broido Kodatsky Hi, s and I'll just ask both of mine. So when we think about that September pressure continuing into the fourth quarter with the two components being COVID staff shortages. I think the general thinking is that COVID is getting a bit better here. So should we take that to mean staff shortages are becoming a bigger portion of the problem into the fourth quarter. And then as a follow-up to that, a little bit harder to predict when those staff pressures ease up. So how long do you think about those impacting volumes and what are you looking forward to indicate that the pressure from staff shortages is easy. ."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Keri Mattox And Sam, did you have another follow-up? I think that was 2 questions in 1, but anything that close out there?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Matson Yes,  for taking my question. I guess I wanted to start with the M&A. I thought you would have done more by now. Are multiples too high, are you waiting to get through all this COVID uncertainty? Do you need to de -lever the Balance Sheet more? Or is there some other reason that you haven't gotten more active in terms of acquisition?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson Yes. So clearly, we would like to do more too, but I got to be honest with you if you think about the COVID pressure from an EBITDA standpoint. And you look at the debt leverage ratio that's created for us, the fact that we've done as much as we have with the limited firepower we do have, is pretty impressive. I'd actually give the team high complements to be able to select targets, get creative in the way that we pay for those targets, even in an environment with high multiples and bringing technologies that are absolutely fundamental to success inside of S.E.T for instance. Our A&E acquisition helps us in our Thoracic space, which is a big growth area for us that  we're focused on. The relying technology that we brought in, filled that significant gaps we had in sports and that gives you the ability then to leverage that full portfolio. And even Omni Suite, which is not overly exciting when you talk about blooms and lights, but it gives us bigger presence in the ASC market. All those things happened in concert with a relationship with Canary for its smart implants -- long-term smart implants beyond just Knee during the time that we just didn't have a lot of firepower. We absolutely expect over the next 5 years to increase that firepower, particularly as COVID gets behind us, and we will then flex more muscle in this area. But, I would say the opposite -- I would say that we did more than I think would have been expected, given the firepower we had."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Matson Okay, that's helpful, and then just looking at -- in the recon category, it looks like your Hips were down substantially more than your Knees in the quarter and I thought that Hips were somewhat less elective and maybe would have been less affected by the COVID wave than Knee is. Is that really just a reflection of the new products and ROSA Knee side or is there something else going on there?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson Yes. So that is a switch because what we have seen in the past and I think everybody has seen that the Knee procedures were lagging behind Hip mainly because you've got 2 factors. Number 1, it really hurts when you got a hip procedure issue. And there is some trauma related to it as well. But I think what you're finding is that that initial wave was where backlog was being consumed at a faster pace with Hip. And some of that has caught up is my view on it. And then the Knee procedures now are -- patients have really been waiting. You got patients that have been out there for a year that are finally coming in to get a procedure. And so I truly do believe these patients have waited as long as they could from a pain threshold standpoint. But now we're entering the market where a lot of those that had significant pain with Hip or trauma were already in the funnel. That's the only thing I can predict, it's the only thing I can see why it's happening. We'll see what happens next quarter, but that's what I think is happening right now."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robbie Marcus . . Suky, on the 100 basis points impact from China next year, is it fair to assume that since its price pretty much just dropped through the bottom line as well?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson That's the right way to think about it, Robbie."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robbie Marcus Got it. So second question, does that hinder your ability to get to your operating margin target at all in 2023? Since I imagine that probably wasn't included. And then just two quick clarifications. If you could let us know what the M&A and selling day benefit was in the quarter. Appreciate it. ."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson Sure. So on the operating margin point, it certainly does add another headwind to get to that 30%. But when we put that 30% aspiration out, there were two big components that we had not contemplated. One was the BPS you just mentioned, but the other was the active portfolio management and the spin of the spine and dental business, which will be margin accretive. We think that those two largely offset one another. So again, that's another reason why we're even in the backdrop of this headwind still confident in our ability to deliver that exit run rate at the end of 2023. Relative to day rate, there is no meaningful headwind, tailwind relative to the day rate. And that's going to be true for the full year as well. And then on the M&A contribution, I would put it in the low single-digits. So if you think about M&A, if you looked at S.E.T. by itself, which is about 20% of our overall revenue, it's in the neighborhood of about 300 bps of benefit. So probably less than a percent for the overall consolidated results. But in S.E.T., it helps by about 300 basis points."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matt Taylor  for taking my question, guys. Bryan, I just wanted to ask you about what you're seeing in the marketplace and predicting COVID -- I know it's very challenging -- what about the last year would help, I guess inform you what we could see for 2022, in terms of how things could start to come back. We have had [Indiscernible] been closed and after the [Indiscernible] in the early part of the year, we saw a strong 2Q in the fields more muted this time in terms of the comeback. Do you think the delta is [Indiscernible] or is there something else going on in terms of what we've seen so far?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson It's just so hard to predict, every time I think I've got it  nailed because I'm looking at trends from the past. I'm wrong, But what I would tell you is I do believe it has been so far and we more recently putting a combination of those two. The Delta surges are absolutely real, and that is impacting capacity in the hospitals less so on the ASC, but definitely the hospital. And staffing surges are very real again, as Suky referenced more in the hospital than the ASC. But both of those things are contributing what we typically look at though, and we still. We still look at starts when is the patient enter the funnel? And usually takes from the time they do to the time to get a procedure 4 to 5 weeks. That seems to be extending now because you've got more people that are entering the funnel, I believe. But here's the thing, we're just not seeing those stats change north versus more than what seasonality would allow. So seasonality is occurring, procedures are increasing. August to September was better, procedurally speaking. We expect the fourth quarter to be better than the third quarter, but that's being muted by these pressures associated with COVID and staffing. And so that's the reason why we're changing the guidance. It's not that procedures aren't increasing, they are. They're just not increasing nearly at the clip we would expect because of these pressures. I wish I could [Indiscernible]. I don't have a better answer, unfortunately."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matt Taylor Sure. There's a lot of [Indiscernible] certainly, but I guess I wanted your view on how much of the staffing is related to COVID. In other words, conceptually, if in 2022 COVID really wanes, do you think there's going to be ongoing staffing issues in the second half of the year or post normalization?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson It's challenging to say because there are multiple components associated with it. Some -- what people are saying is that, is this mandate for vaccinations that is driving some of this change? So if that were to be changed, if say vaccination requirements change because COVID starts to leave the pressure point, maybe. But I don't know, I think that although they may have started because of the COVID challenges, just because of COVID vaccination pressures, whatever it may be -- I don't know that they're going to work in sync. That's just my guess because I have no idea. But my guess is they're somewhat disconnected now, and you may see  lingering staffing beyond COVID."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Imron Zafar Hi, .  for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on how you're thinking about blended implant ASPS in the U.S. over the next couple of years in large joints. Obviously, a lot of moving parts with new products, higher mix of Robotics, maybe ASPS versus inpatient, case mix, things like that. Just [Indiscernible] -- how you're thinking about implant ASPS over the next couple of years. ."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson So I'd answer that in 2 ways. First and foremost, we're going to focus on is pricing discipline in the organization. And so if I just take everything else out of the equation, we look to be able to mute some of the pricing impact that we've been experiencing as an organization for a long time. So that up by itself could obviously help from an ASP standpoint just by doing better job on the pricing front, that's one area. Separate from that, a big focus for us is mix benefit. The fact is when we think about share of wallet in a procedure, a lot of the technologies we're launching actually do have an effect of taking up the amount of money you make per procedure. And so if I think about Robotics, you've got a premium. Every time somebody uses a Robotic procedure in that procedure. We think about Cementless, you get a premium every time somebody uses it. We think about Mymobility. Every time somebody uses it, you get a premium in that procedure. So we would actually expect as we get deeper penetration in these key areas of technology -- Persona IQ is another one. As we get deeper technology penetration, we would expect the ASP that we capture inside of an existing procedure to go up and actually be a tailwind for market growth."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Imron Zafar Okay, , . And then secondly, can you just talk about your latest views on the opportunity internationally for ROSA, what your latest thoughts are and timing in key international markets? ."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson Yeah. I'd say we've been very happy actually, with our ability to get traction with robotics very early on outside the U.S. A lot of times, we see a nice split between our U.S. business and our OUS business. I truly do believe in certain markets, specifically Asia-Pacific. We have an opportunity to surpass anybody in the robotics space. If we continue with the trends that we're seeing, we could be the number one share player in robotics pretty quickly in Asia-Pacific, and not in the too far distance in EMEA. It could take a little longer in the U.S., but those are the way we look at it. We don't want to just get presence in the U.S., we want to make sure that we're getting traction in OUS as well. And so far, we've seen that."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Keri Mattox Anthony, do we have you on the line?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Petrone .  for taking my question. Maybe just to double back on staffing. It seems like there's a number of headwinds as it relates to staffing, whether it be just staff burnout, turnover, just in terms of personnel from healthcare services to industry. And we also heard early retirements could be a big trend in 4Q. So when you think about sort of the stack of headwinds out there, how deep into 2022 do you think some of these trends could last and what do you think that could mean in terms of throughput for ortho recon specifically? And then the quick follow-up would be just on as we navigate the next few quarters, just a recap on pricing for both hips and knees.  again."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson Yes. So again, I think it's really challenging to try to project when staffing concerns are going to end. I think what's interesting about it is just the fact that there are staffing concerns is driving a whole new sub-market for nurses and other folks because you can leave the hospital you're in and you can become a traveling nurse and you can get paid a lot more than you're getting paid inside of the hospital you're at. And so if you're willing to take that flexibility, you're willing to travel, you can get paid a lot more. So it's creating a whole new sub market for nurses, which is exacerbating the problem. I just can't predict it. I'd love to be able to for you, but I'm definitely assuming it's going to happen -- continue to happen in 2022. I just -- I can't say with any accuracy when it would stop. And could you just repeat the second question you had?"
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Petrone Apologies just as we sort of navigate this period here with some of the Delta headwinds in staffing and in particular staffing with some inflationary pressure in hospitals, just how you think that will translate to pricing, as we head into next year."
4465535,Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.,ZBH,11/4/2021,CEO Bryan Hanson on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bryan Hanson I got you. That's a  because if you think about it, as people are having to pay for traveling nurses, they're paying a lot more, too, and they're trying to retain their talent in this market, which also cost s more. But this is nothing new. I mean, hospitals get pressured all the time in their margin. And they pressure us all the time from a pricing standpoint. So no matter what the pressure they're feeling, there's going to be really no change associated with how much pressure they put on us for pricing. And so I don't predict any real change in our pricing dynamics as a result of this. As we've said before, I actually would predict over the five-year strap plan to reduce the pricing impact for a number of reasons. Number 1, just better pricing discipline as an organization and number 2, better contracting skills as we contract, particularly with ROSA in place, in multi-category contracting, we can stabilize our pricing. There's clearly going to be headwinds and there's clearly going to be people looking for better pricing. There' s no question about that. I don't believe this particular variable will change the dynamic there though. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Keri Mattox for any additional or closing remarks. , Lauren, and  everyone for your questions today. Of course, we'll be speaking to many of you today, tomorrow and throughout the next couple of weeks. If you have questions and need more information, please don't hesitate to reach out to the IR team anytime.  so much for joining.  again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Seth Seifman I guess maybe starting off, if you could tell us where you expect to exit the year on – in terms of rate on the two major narrow-body programs, on 737 and on A320?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Okay. For A320, the 45 rate that Airbus has called out seems to be the right number. In terms of Boeing, I've seen so many numbers, but it's really hard for us to know exactly what's the correct one. So I'm going to go with the – probably Skyline at 14 aircraft per month, even though I've seen reports of – last July on the 16 number, which I didn't recognize then and the 19 number. So I don't know, Seth. I'm going to stick with my 14 with the expectation uplift in the first quarter next year."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Seth Seifman Okay, very good. I will obey the moderate stick to one and get back in queue. ."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robert Stallard John, I think I'll follow up on Seth's question with regard to the Boeing 787. Where are you at the moment? And what have you baked into that 2022 revenue number with regard to what the 787 deliveries could do? ."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Okay. So, first of all, original expectation, if you went back six months, it was the 787 would continue through this year at rate 5 per month, clearly with Boeing wanting to reduce that in the latter part of the year. As far as we can see Boeing went as 0 build condition for 90 days. And while they've adjusted the rate for the fourth quarter to 2, my thought has been it' s been a 0 build and then it will be built at may be 4 a month to 2 average that 2. I don't really know, there's some speculation that maybe have built to 2, but it's pretty opaque to us. The most important factor is when does recertification occur because whether they build or don't build, it's going to come out of inventory. And we've seen inventories drop as well. And so suppliers into the 787 have been low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the fourth quarter. And then the question is what will the rate be in 2022. Our thought at this point is that maybe a 2022 annual build might be 48 aircrafts, I don't know. We've had to make some guesstimates, and that's provided for in that 12% to 15% volume increase that I talked about in revenues as an initial thought for 2022. And that takes account of what we think the balance of probability is across all of the end markets that we serve. And maybe I'll just continue a bit further to give a better color is when you consider the overall uncertainty in the industry regarding liquidation of inventories and in particular, the – in wide-body, and the fact that it will probably be flat for a further 12 months, the supply chain issues, which are certainly very newsworthy but are real. And indeed caused the truck production to be lower in the third quarter, that's also combined with the annual shutdowns in Europe. And then, of course, this – I'm going to call 0 build condition or is it only 2 on the 787. Then I think the sequential growth is outstanding. And all we're doing is not debating the fact of recovery, but what's the exact angle of the slope of recovery. And that's about it really, Rob."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robert Stallard Yes. Just one clarification, John. Are you therefore, assuming that the destock on the 787 is now done and you're basically going to be following the Boeing build rate?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant You tell me what the build rate is going to be, and I'll tell you the destock is where I find myself. No, I'm not trying to be clever about the response to question, but I find myself in a position where we've been grappling all year with moving end markets. You're grappling with all the different end markets moving at different ways, whether it's industrial or commercial transportation or commercial aero or defense and you've got all of these things moving around. And then you overlaid that with some very specific issues at Boeing, which we know about but none of us knows the recertification date. And in fact, Boeing have not provided that guidance either themselves."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Myles Walton . . I was wondering if I could ask one  detail and one question about 2022. In the detail one, I think, the Structures business was more anticipated to be a fourth quarter growth. And obviously, you saw some pretty  sequential growth here in Structures and out of commercial aero in particular. Could you maybe talk to why that happened a little bit sooner? And then secondarily, the defense expectation for 2022, can you just benchmark where that is in the 12% to 15% top-line? ."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Yes. So let me deal with Structures first. I think that the growth is a little bit higher in our third quarter. I think it would be similar for fourth. And then depending on 787, I could see some inventory correction in the first quarter, don't know enough yet to really know. In terms of defense, of course, we all know that there's a little bit of seasonality to that, where we do get a second half lift generally, which is a little bit of payback in the first quarter on a use it or lose it basis for defense budgets for spares in particular. Defense for next year, I'm guessing at this point that I'm not going to get too far to 2022. But I'll say, fairly flat, if anything, given what Raytheon said about the rate reduction in engine that they see on the – let's say, the original equipment build side. Then that will be fairly muted for us and then maybe there'll be some pickup on the spare side. So it's difficult to really know there. And then the question is to what degree we'll see level loading from Lockheed on the overall business. So best guess is at the moment, I'd say, we shouldn't be anticipating too much by way of defense growth next year, but we should be expecting good growth in terms of the narrow-body commercial aircraft production and then continuing growth in IGT. And also we do anticipate some of these supply chain constraints will be affecting the commercial truck business to move away certainly by the second half of the year."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,John Plant It's all contained in that 12 to 15 best guess. And I don't want to call it a best guess rather than a guide at this point.
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Strauss So John, obviously, the  announcement here recently, you've decided to stay on a bit longer. Maybe a little bit of color on your thinking there and how might longer, how might – longer might that be?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Well, sorry, you're disappointed, David, if my being around is going to sort of plague your life a little bit longer. But – no, basically, the color I'd give you is the Board concluded that Tolga wasn't demonstrating the leadership they felt necessary to succeed myself as simple as that. I think it's  credit to the Board that the they stepped up and made a determination and exercise that judgment. I think it's one of the most important things that a Board does. I've said that I'm willing to continue to lead Howmet through the aerospace recovery. As I talked about, all with all the different changes in all these end markets that we've covered already, but certainly discuss again that I think that will hopefully be to the benefit of the company. And with no specific end dates provided, so yes, I'm going to be talking to you for some time."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Strauss All right. Perfect, John. Happy to have you here around."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gautam Khanna A couple of questions – maybe a two-part question. I was just curious you gave a ballpark range for sales for next year. Do you want to venture a guess on EBITDA margin, adjusted EPS, just to calibrate people in front of the formal guide that's going to happen next quarter. Just maybe if you can talk through some of the moving pieces."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant I don't really want to get that far ahead of myself, Gautam. I feel positive about next year. I'm convinced that – I can convince myself anyway that when we do guide, it will be healthy for next year without, again, saying what exactly what I mean by healthy because I don't want to give specific numbers for increased EBITDA and earnings per share. But right now, despite all the, I'll call it, uncertainties, and of course as you know, many companies are still not providing much by way of guidance or sometimes not at all, is that we feel confident enough to give you what we've already given you. And I feel confident enough to say that 2022 will be a healthy year for us. And that will be a combination of both – for both EBITDA and for cash flow."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gautam Khanna Okay. And one other thing, we've heard incrementally some concerns about in the auto industry related to magnesium and what have you. I just – I'm curious, is this – are you seeing incrementally more difficult pinch points emerge? I mean, just – I know since last quarter, it sounds like things have gotten tougher on the supply chain."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,John Plant We're not a massive user. We've already covered through the next few months and so no big deal for Howmet now.
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matt Akers Yes, hi, . Actually kind of to follow up on the last one. I guess some of the concerns I've heard is the magnesium shortage potentially close to kind of less aluminum? And I guess, is that an area where you guys are seeing any risk of lack of material availability or just kind of how long are you covered with sort of the inventory that's available?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Yes. I really don't believe that we're going to be calling out lack of magnesium as an issue for us meeting any guide that we give you at all. We looked at it recently. I can't make the exact numbers, but both when you look at the amount we use and – and then the – say, the contract commitments we've got, we are setting it in an okay territory. So it's not top of mind in terms of my worries. In fact, on the aero side, I don't really have much by way of input materials concerns at all. And the only time I have a concern is the way it affects our customers on the Commercial Transportation side."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paretosh Misra . . I had a question on your metal pass-through. So EBITDA margins are somewhat affected in the Wheels business because of the aluminum pass-through. But in the commercial aerospace business, we don't see a similar impact, even though the nickel prices have been very high, and I'm sure the other metal prices also went up. Is it because just th at metal price is a much smaller component in aerospace? Or is there some difference in how revenues recorded in the two businesses?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant No. I mean, the principle is exactly the same, Paretosh. So I rarely call out things. So for example, you don't hear me talking about bad weather in Texas. You don't hear me talking about a particular press going down, why not talk too much about labor and this sort of stuff. It's just we work off, just normal course of business. And indeed, for the – for margins, if you look at nickel, cobalt, all of these metals into our aerospace segments have also had very significant increases. It has aluminum into some of the bulk end in our structures business, and some elements of titanium, although titanium has been pretty muted in aggregate. So I just look at all of those things and say, I tend not to call out much. It's just that I think it was on the last call where it was Seth from JPM that was asking specifically about Wheels and the margin, and it's very noticeable for that segment. And so I had to comment about it. And basically, this quarter is exactly the same. So there's a metal impact. So last quarter, it was like at the company level, so I don't really get into it at the segment level, it was 30 basis points. And this quarter, it's about 20 basis points of impact. And I just called it out for the – for that Wheels segment. And obviously, I wanted to I'd be saying to you things like, well, 22.8 really is 23. And if I added a bit more on for aerospace, it's higher than that. But it's like I don't think it's worthy. And so just don't comment, just move on. And our job is to manage these things. And one day when metal begins to abate and goes the other way, maybe I won't be calling it out when things are really good either. So that's about it. But if you want to, use 20 or 30 basis points for aluminum impact on the total holdco for Howmet year-to-date."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Noah Poponak John, I just wanted to see if I could make sure I understand where Fastening Systems is and it's kind of sequential process since it started to decline later, and I think it still has some inventory destocking. It sounds like you're expecting that to be kind of flat sequentially in  the fourth quarter. And then I think previously, you talked about it growing year-over-year in the first quarter, which would require a decent sequential step up. Is that the right shape? And just maybe you could talk about where that segment is in terms of snapping back to the actual end demand?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Yes. If you listened to my words carefully, what I spoke to earlier, I actually used the word first half rather than the first quarter. I don't mean by slide, but at least I'll call it out and be open about it, is that previously, we'd said that the destocking – and in particular, the washout through the wide-body we would like to be complete by the end of the year, and we start to see improvements in the first quarter of next year. I want to be a little bit more cautious today. And essentially, I'm going to hang it all on 787 because, as I said earlier, I don't know exactly what the build, but then neither does anybody seem to know the exact build. And so my assumption is that it's less likely that it will be back at rate five in January. And so based upon that, I'm going to say it's more like a Q2 effect. But again, you tell me 787, I'll tell you what fasteners does because it's significant in the life of that business. My assumption is the rest is pretty flat, wide-body, by improving on narrowbody. So it's really difficult to be precise on any of this at this point in time. That's why all I know is that recovery is occurring, revenues are going up. And the only thing we were really debating here is just what exactly is the angle, that requires us to make a judgment around labor inputs. The rest just falls into place when we know the angle will be upswing. And so I just think that's – let's not get too wrapped around on a minute. The answer is good things are occurring a lot of moving parts, but generally, things are looking positive."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Noah Poponak It sounds like that's probably hit its low watermark given 87 is already down. And then to your point, it's a debate around timing and pace of recovery. But it probably doesn't need to go lower based on everything you just said."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Yes. I mean anticipating that some are going to be built. But again, it's not that we know precisely exactly what build rate is. But – so at the moment, I'll just say, yes, I completely stand at an average of two for the quarter with that now the exact shape of production, whether it's just one or two, or is it zero and then three or four, I don't know. It doesn't really matter."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Noah Poponak Yes. I mostly just was in how much inventory stock has left.
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Yes, the critical thing is when recertification – and at that point, the sky begin to turn blue. And the things just begin to feel a bit better. That's why I give you a broad calibration of where I think we're going to head towards next year."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Noah Poponak So is there no inventory destock left in that segment?
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Well, there is while they've just got the bill down to the end of the – let's call it two level. Yes, the corrective inventory again."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Phil Gibbs Doing well. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the aftermarket, particularly as it relates to the air foils side? And then also whether or not we should expect you to have some price increase opportunities next year?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Okay. So first of all, we did see an uptick in the aftermarket demand in coils in Q3. We're expecting a similar sort of improvement in the fourth quarter. So overall, it's good to see. But of course, as I've explained before, because the level comes off a really low level, then what I talk about as an increase as a percentage, it's notable, it's not exactly  in terms of dollar terms. Our thought is that, that continues on the talking, generally Commercial Aerospace and the air foils that will continue to show further growth in 2022. Within the overall Commercial Aerospace, clearly, business jet is doing quite well. And we say at that moment, that segment, is healthy. And we expect to see improvements in narrow-body as we move through the next few quarters to quite a healthy level in 2022. So I think then the dollars do become more significant for us because a similar percentage increase on a larger dollar base begins to become more material. Price increases, my statement is, I think that 2022 will be – will be positive, not as big as 2021. That's not in terms of a difference in percentage but more in terms of just the base for  renewal. So that's the what I'd say that subject."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Phil Gibbs . And then as a follow-up, Ken, on the interest expense side, what should we be modeling relative to the $63 million level that we saw in the third quarter on a run rate basis looking ahead with all the moves you've made? Congrats. ."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Josh Sullivan Just curious on the conversations around the overall cost reductions potentially for the F-35 program. How are – or are those discussions reaching your desk yet, either on price, volumes, redesigns? Just curious how you're navigating that."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant We had conversations on that more over a year ago, so no update since then. I mean the – I think being public about our – the LTA was renewed and pricing settled on that program. So nothing going on at the moment."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"George Shapiro John, just a quick couple for you. Is the ship set value of a 787 between $6 million to $7 million, in that way we can obviously put in our own expectations for what the build rate is going to be next year?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant I've never been willing to call out ship set values, George. There's guesstimates out there, but it's not a place that I want to go because cutting out ship set values are people trying to model things up and down when they don't know exactly what they all are, what the inventory takes, put and takes  are. I think it just clouds the whole position. I think I'd much rather keep people focused on the big relevant numbers, which essentially is how I guide. And basically, clearly, always people are going to go up or down around that. I always think I'd give you a really ahead of me, I think we get below me, and that's how I think about it. But chipset value is an area I'm not being prepared to go."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"George Shapiro Okay. And then just a follow-up on your comments in the wheel business. You said you expect the supply chain issues to maybe resolve by next year. So can you tell us the ballpark is how much you would expect that wheel business to grow next year, if that's the case?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Seth Seifman  for the follow-up. I guess, John, maybe to go about the margin question in a less direct way. You've talked in the past about…"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Seth Seifman That’s okay, kind of a target sort of incremental for the business as a whole. Is there any reason to think that 2022 should be significantly above or below that sort of target incremental level you've discussed in the past?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant No, I don't think so. My – clearly, we start going to be the sort of incrementals you saw in the third quarter, which yearly are fabulous. And the fact that we not only called it but did it is good. I think best guess for next year is that normalized the sort of level that we've talked about in the past. So let's use the word 35% plus or minus, and apply that to the volume side of the – whatever the volume is. And then you only adjust it fractionally for the whole issue of dollar of metal and a dollar of revenue in terms of recovery. So that's the one where you can get it wrong, I think. Assuming we do our staff operationally and keep it on the full incremental, even though that's going to be really good if we do that."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Seth Seifman All right. Okay. Very good. And either John or Ken, if you could maybe run through some of the – not operational but sort of big moving pieces we can think about for cash next year, so kind of pension, CapEx, tax working capital?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant I think the gross liability reduction is probably something is fundamentally underappreciated. I mean, well over $0.5 billion of gross liabilities come off the balance sheet, which inherently reduces its volatility to both mortality and the interest rates going forward. So I treat that as a really outstanding outcome with essentially very little cash used to achieve that. And it's hard to draw a line between that exactly in value, but it does matter in terms of what that gross and then also the net liabilities are for the company."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Seth Seifman . . And then, since we're in the second round here, if I can overstate my welcome. It sounds like you're done hiring for this year. Is there – where are you set for in terms of people, in terms of how far sort of into next year before the next round of adding folks might come?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant It's difficult to exactly know at this point. As you say, we've taken on, say, net 800 into the engine business, if you asked me before, I thought we would have been hiring in Q1. I'm not really sure if I call it today. I think we probably will be towards the end of Q1. And we want to take a cautious view on all of that. I mean there's a lot of stuff that's got to play out here, all the uncertain I talked to. I'll give you piece of information here. You didn't ask for it just because it is interesting. Just by way of information, our vaccination rate is over 70% across the company, between 70% and 75%. So that's been responding fairly well to the encouragement that we've been providing to our workforce to provide that protection for everybody. And we hope it continues to improve."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Strauss All right. . I don't think you mentioned this, John, but 2022 price negotiations, where those stand today, how far are you through that? And what might pricing look like relative to 2021?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Exactly in line with what I previously said, is that 2022 will be a lower year than 2021 by a significant demand. It will still be healthy, but just the – I'll call it the natural flow of the LTA renewals. So I would say, all in order there from the previous, I'll say, dialogue. What was the part question, part from?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Strauss Yes, I think that was it. Yes, as a follow-up, I think you've gotten some relief to do higher levels of cash return between dividends and share repo. But what about the potential to even get more relief, just given where your balance sheet is and the cash generation looks like that will come through next year?"
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Plant Well, first of all, we've certainly increased both the authorization and the scale of baskets that we have to do that. Critical to that in terms of utilization of those baskets is the view of the industry and the strength of view of that industry, and maybe some of the current uncertainties. It would be  to see those recede. I mean we've talked very clear about the solid recovery of the narrow-body business. And then recertification, I think it would be  to see, let's say, the 737 certified in China, the 787 recertified, I'd say, globally to build condition. And then I think those give us further confidence in deployment. If I roll myself forward let's say, a year, I'm not really sure whether – depending upon exactly what I'll guide to by way of cash flow for next year. I don't know whether there will be, much by way of restrictions a year from now, if any. But I'm not sure it actually would change the mindset over what we'll be prepared to do. So I think we'll again take a forward view of what our leverage will be, how much wings deployed, what's the overall confidence level in doing so. And basically to provide a balanced set of returns to our stakeholders or our shareholders, in particular."
4465537,Howmet Aerospace's,HWM,11/4/2021,CEO John Plant on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,John Plant . This concludes today's conference call.  for participating. You may now disconnect.
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Ryskin . , guys and congrats on a strong quarter and raised the guide. I want to start on DRAXXIN real quick. You touched on generic impact in US livestock a number of times in your remarks, we assume that's predominantly from DRAXXIN. Can you give us an update if you're seeing any stabilization there or are you expecting for the headwinds in 4Q '22 or 4Q or 2022 or given those trends improve and stabilize from here?"
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Louise Chen Hi.  for taking my question here. So, as we start to think about 2022, what are some of the pushes and pulls hereperce for example, will recovery from food services and restaurants be a tailwind in 2022 for livestock? And what else should we be thinking about? ."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nathan Rich  so much. If I can maybe follow up on the revenue outlook, Wetteny, for 4Q. I think historically 4Q has been a bit of a stronger quarter. You mentioned the competition on DRAXXIN. Is there any other dynamic that we should have in mind in terms of the revenue cadence for the fourth quarter? And I guess, with the focus on inflation and cost pressures in the market, do you feel like you've seen any pre-buying of products or stocking up from customers in either the livestock or companion business. ."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jon Block . , guys. . See if I can [Indiscernible] a couple. The first on livestock and quite honestly was pleasantly surprised by the international livestock up 7% operationally. There's just a lot of noise out there with other companies and swine chatter. So, I guess the first question is, was that a clean number? No pull forwards and maybe just talk to this market overall, do you still view it as a low single-digit grower for you this year with eventual improvement to mid-single-digit in call it '22/'23? And then just a pivot, Kristin or Wetteny. I know we're not going to get a 2022 guide, but maybe conceptually at a high level, how do we think of '22 in terms of a year where the delta -- how do we think about the delta between revenue and EPS growth? And I guess where I'm going with this is a lot of innovation for you where you're still dominating the market. So conceptually, do we just think about it as another year of spending, supporting the portfolio of DTC where the delta between those 2 revenues -- revs and EPS might be a little bit tighter than prior years? And sorry for the long-winded questions. ."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Erin Wright Okay. . Can you provide us any metrics on the contributions from Librela and Solensia in the quarter or any metrics around reorder rates of the products in certain markets and how the launch is progressing relative to your expectations at this point in the expected timeline again for the US launch. And then second, just more broadly on Companion Animal trends. Any monthly metrics you can give us over the course of the quarter and kind of what's expected for the fourth quarter and beyond in terms of the underlying demand trends across that market? ."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Schott .  so much for the questions. I just -- my question on the derm portfolio, you've built a billion-dollar franchise here, but it's really about competition coming in 2022 or beyond. What are you anticipating in terms of the impact that a competitor launch could have? I think historically you've talked about a second entry, more building the market than maybe directly cannibalizing your existing business. But I guess as you've had a longer window of time to develop this, do we reach a point where that competitive launch, I guess, more impacts your growth versus -- I guess the heart of the question is, how much more room is there for market expansion as a new player comes in?  so much."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Balaji Prasad Hi. .  for questions. Main focus on China, but the [Indiscernible] and it's because you often spoken about China as a major market, understandably. Can you help us understand the expectation that are in the market and any comparative range of prizes that you think this market would support? And also, far behind would applicable to be in terms of getting introduced are launched in China. ."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Scala . I have a question on Librela and Solensia in Europe. There are several parts of the question. Are owners are returning monthly for the next injection or is the time between injections longer than that? What is the average patient cost of each injection? And just to clarify, I think you said Solensia in cash is $200 million opportunity. Why is that? Why is that only $200 million? Why isn't it multiples of that? ."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Christine Rains Hi. Congrats on a  quarter  and . My question is that we noticed that Trio declined sequentially for the first time, so I was just hoping to have some color on this and how it's performing versus your expectations. ."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Navaan Ty . Can you share your stats of pet ownership going forward and average revenue per Companion Animal visit? And apologies if I missed them. And can I quickly ask are you able to comment on the EU Commission investigation to the Belgian office? I understand it was related to anti-trust allegation. .
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dave Westenberg . . I have a question on potential competition for Simparica Trio. I know it's been a bit of a moving target. I think initially you thought it could even happen this year and I think it's been pushed out to the rate three times, perhaps to second half of '22. Just curious. I know competitor tight-lipped about what they're doing. But any thoughts from year-end and why there continues to be a delay here, do you think it's regulatory? Or it -- could it be technical? And if it's technical, is this something that could delay competition for many years to come? And then just -- hypothetically, if competition comes into derm segment around the same time as competition comes for Simparica Trio, do you think you have the flexibility to show above segment growth during this period? ."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kristin Peck Sure. I wish we knew exactly. I mean, we had the same theories that you do that there could be certain technical reasons for some competitors. And let me be clear. Everyone's working in this space. This is the parasiticides. It's the largest single market in Animal Health at $5 billion. So, I think if you're pretty much any of the large companies we compete with, they're all trying to come up with their own triple combination. So, I don't know that it's the same thing that's holding each of the companies back. I mean, we're not really clear. It definitely could be regulatory, it could be technical, it could be manufacturing CMC. We're not exactly clear. And to your point, there's really very few public companies who actually disclose much about their pipeline. So, our ability to know where people are is quite limited. We just -- and we always -- I know it's a little [Indiscernible] keep pushing it out. Sort of like 6 to 12 months from whenever you ask the question because we haven't seen it and we haven't heard it in corporate accounts and they're negotiating with us, we think it's definitely another 3 -- every quarterly with another 3 plus months out. And that's really where some of our back comes from. And yes, we are confident that even if you'll see, we are planning on competition in these key products, but I think that it's the strength and diversity of our pipeline globally that makes us confident we can continue to grow above market. We've got diagnostics, we've got pain mAb. We still think you're going to be growing in [Indiscernible] to be honest with you, it's still a lot of unmet medical needs, so yes, we remain confident that we can grow above the market even if we do start to face competition in some of these key franchises. And we'll take a follow-up from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Balaji Prasad Hi,  for the follow-up. And just a question on DRAXXIN, I mean, [Indiscernible] in detail, but I know that you've got approval for DRAXXIN KP in July, probably launches some time in Q3. So, a lot of expectations from the KPs [Indiscernible] ensure that the market stays flat or is this go for this to [Indiscernible] growth? And secondly, on the same, it seemed that 'til now [Indiscernible] launched January versions. You call out a couple of more generates. Any more are you expecting next year? ."
4465538,Zoetis Inc.,ZTS,11/4/2021,CEO Kristin Peck on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kristin Peck Sure. DRAXXIN KP was part of our defense strategy. I don't think it's going to restart growth for us necessarily to market as we're seeing generic competition, but it is as Wetteny outlined in his remarks at the beginning of this call. It's helped us retain our share. It provides incremental innovation and incremental benefit to our customers and a reason, obviously, to stay with that. Yes, we have had in the US two competitor s so far. We've heard up to three more are potentially coming. I don't know why they haven't -- we would've expected them this year, so their approval -- whether or not they actually entered the market, we're not really --we not sure when and if on that, but we would've said we probably have a few more entering. It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Kristin Peck for closing remarks. . Look,  everyone for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, I think we delivered another strong quarter of results driven by our diverse global portfolio and strength in Petcare parasiticides and dermatology products. We are raising our guidance for the full-year 2021 and we remain on track for a record-setting year for us. And we're continuing to invest in the areas to support our long-term growth. And we remain confident in the fundamental growth drivers for animal health and for Zoetis into 2022 and beyond. So,  so much for joining us today. Have a  day. This will conclude today's program.  for your participation. You may now disconnect."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Elizabeth Anderson Hey, guys.  and  so much for the question. I was just wondering if you could go into a little bit of detail perhaps on the T&E segment at what your -- what's implied in your guidance for the fourth quarter. I know some of -- the shine called us people were -- you know, had some questions about when revenues were getting recognized off with DS World and some delays in shipments, and some equipment, etc. so I just wanted to -- and installation. So I just want to make sure I'm understanding that portion of it. ."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez , Elizabeth. . Yes, what we're seeing for T&E going into the fourth quarter is along the lines of what we said in our prepared remarks, which is we have  momentum. There is  demand for Primescan,  demand for Axeos and imaging, in general. The timing of sales relative to DS World most of those sales actually happened in the fourth quarter. We, there was a lot of  excitement. And so in our guidance for the fourth quarter, we are including the substantial growth for CAD and for imaging in general. So the performance is in that business, that part of the business continues to be strong."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Elizabeth Anderson Okay. . That's helpful. And maybe just switched over to the clear aligner. I know you said that maybe there was a slight about if weakness in sort of the DTC market. Can you go into maybe what you think is driving that, and then maybe contrast it to how you're seeing SureSmile."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Casey  for the question. The DTC segment obviously benefited from the pandemic. And as we're kind of entering this recovery phase, we're seeing across not just the DTC clear aligner space, but a number of consumer businesses -- consumers have choices in terms of where they're spending discretionary income. And all of a sudden, people are going on vacations and other things. So we think we're seeing a little bit of seasonality and we're seeing some competition for discretion. And are we spending among our core target audience what we think going forward first is that look, we think clear aligners are clear aligner strategy is predicated on look, we've got a DTC space and we've DTC entry and we have obviously a director Dennis entry and we'll look to, see growth in both of those segments. As what we saw in Q3 -- again, a little bit of seasonality. We think this is a little bit of consumers looking at other discretionary spending. I would tell you we were -- obviously, when we sit down and prepare all this stuff, we would reflect on the fact that in basically the second quarter of 2018, we had 0 sales in Clear Aligners and today we've got a -- if it was as independent SBU, it would be 1 of our more significant franchises and 1 that we expect to continue providing a lot of growth into the future."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Elizabeth Anderson And that -- those comments you said, I know that you focus mostly on the DTC market, but with SureSmile, would you say you're seeing similar type trends or do those diverge anywhere?"
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Casey Now, they're a little bit divergent. SureSmile continued to -- it continues to perform as we thought. It's demonstrated very, very consistent results. We're o ptimistic as we begin to push that outside the U.S. and we have made progress doing that, that we expect to see continued growth on SureSmile. The plans for Byte are also to begin to pick that up. I mean, we're looking at Byte in a couple different ways. I mean, the first is we have new products that are coming that direction, Part 1. Part 2 is we believe that there's opportunity to expand this outside the U.S. We think the DTC channel in places in Asia and other areas is doing pretty well. So we really think that we've got a  product and want to participate in those regions. And then one of the things that we remain optimistic about is we really think that Byte is going to play a role with our relationships with the professional. Obviously, when people come into Byte, not everybody is eligible for Byte. They can be referred over to dentists that we believe that would have Primescan and other things and go right into SureSmile. So the Byte to us is a strategic play that gives us opportunities to grow in a number of different areas."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tycho Peterson . Don, I hate to nitpick after a beat-and-raise quarter, but just following up on last questions. You did have targets out there for the clear aligners about $300 million for the year, so where are you trending on Byte versus that $200 million Byte targets that you've laid out? And how do you know it's not a competitive issue? Obviously, they need to see channels gotten pretty competitive."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Casey A couple of things. Tycho, we're not going to give you the exact numbers on Byte, but it's a little bit soft. I mean, we're not talking a major issue. We want to be as transparent as we possibly can. So we're telling you guys what we're seeing. We don't think it's a competitive issue that's where we feel like we're losing ground to other entries based on a lot of different things. Obviously, we're serving in the market. We obviously pulse and watch what's going on wit h unique visitors. We -- our process involve somebody coming into the franchise, buying a diagnostic kit and then hopefully buying aligners, so we have an opportunity to really talk to people and see where they're departing the funnel. And at this point, we really don't feel that there is a -- been a significant change in the momentum of getting people from what kind of the purchasing the diagnostic kit, to actually purchasing diagnostics. We feel that it's much more of a narrowing of the funnel than losing people to competitors in the funnel."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tycho Peterson Okay. And then follow-up on supply chain, obviously topping issue or. I'm just curious what you're seeing in the channel in terms of inventory levels, our dealers starting to stockpile? Are you running into shortages? Are you able to pass on higher shipping costs? Can you maybe just give us a little bit of a walk through on what you're seeing on the supply chain side right now?"
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez In fact, I'll take that question. Yes. As I indicated in my remarks, there are challenges. So far -- I also said this. So far for us, we have not been impacted in terms of our ability to manufacture products or to supply our distributors. It is something that we are monitoring very closely. The supply chain team is doing a  job because the reality is, it is harder now to find certain components. It is more expensive in some cases to procure certain materials. We have managed all of that so far. So with respect to what we're seeing in the inventory pipeline or channel, we haven't seen any major disruption or any changes, really, of material significant at this point. But as you know, this is a global situation and it's something that is hard to predict at this point. But so far, we -- our financials are not -- have not been impacted by the supply and -- supply chain issues in a material way older than some elevated costs that we have been able to upset. Or in some cases, for example, we did a price increase, we announced a price increase effective October first, some of that helps upset some of the incremental costs that we are all facing."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tycho Peterson Okay. And then on the cost side is wage inflation in kind of the hiring challenges changed your kind of customer view on automation digital to digitization. I mean, having a tough time staffing these days is that kind of driven more towards digital in your perspective or is it too early?"
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez No, I think we think so. Certainly, there are shortages of labor in many space s, many industries and dental is 1 of them. Staffing issues, as you said, and dentist offices are becoming a little bit challenging and all of that motivates our customers to think about ways of improving the automation, the efficiency and their practices. And I think that is reflected on the strong momentum that we have, that we have seen in all of our digital equipment, including digital scanners and 3D units, so I think that is happening. I think there is accelerating in that trend and it's something that is going to really expedite this digital transformation that we have been talking about for a little while now."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tom Stephan Hey, guys. This is Tom Stephan on for John. s. Sorry to belabor this, but want to go back to Byte. Can you guys just elaborate a bit on the macro headwinds you called out? Maybe specifically how they look today versus what you saw in 3Q. Are those headwinds maybe abating a bit relative to 3Q? And then as attack on, did the Apple iOS changes have any impacts on Byte results? And if so, do you believe you're starting to navigate those challenges?"
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Casey I'll answer it. , Tom, for the question. I'll answer the second part first and the first part, second. Look, the Apple change obviously impacts how Facebook and other things are purchased and how we interact with that. We -- 1 of the reasons we bought Byte was they have a really, really good team that is very sophisticated in how we go about creating demand and how we use different aspects of the digital mix whether it's search engine optimization, whether it's social media, whether it's doing things like affiliates or insurance or other things so, we've worked our way through that. In terms of what headwinds are we seeing in Q3 that are different than Q2? What Q3 is vacation time? I mean, look, you had our our feeling is and we've looked at this and we've talked to a number of our customers or potential customers and people, we get them in. Hey, look, you expend $20 with us to get the diagnostic kit. Why aren't you could take the next step and literally people were talking about, well, we were taking our first vacation since the pandemic and other things. So statistically, we, basically, we think there's seasonality associated with people going on vacation, people heading into school, and then it is somewhat confounded by what's going on and the kind of the pandemic where you've got pent-up demand for consumer spending in other areas. And the thing that we're still trying to quantify and we were going to continue to watch it and work through it. Obviously, there was a change in the third quarter about government payment related to pandemic recovery things, so we're working through a bunch of this stuff, but I really -- I think Tycho just said it well, I do want to point out that we just posted a pretty significant growth in the quarter and we're raised, and 1 of the things that we look about, we have a broad-based portfolio and we think that we're growing in the majority of it and we're optimistic that we're going to grow Byte in the future."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tom Stephan . That's really helpful. And then just on the 2021 top-line guidance, the implied 4Q, I think suggests maybe a m odest sequential growth. And T&E sounds like it will be very strong just due to DS World. So on the other side of that, how should we think about consumables? Are there any puts and takes on the end markets or just, in general, growth and the trajectory there? ."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez Yes, Tom. I'll take the question. I think the -- there is a good increase from Q3 to Q4 sequentially. So when you do the math, I mean, that -- the sequential growth implied is several percentage points, probably 4% to 5% points, so that is a good jump. There is -- specifically with respect to your question about consumables, there's always -- between quarters, there is always a possibility of timing, situations, and I indicated before we announced a price increase for October 1st, and this is the annual price increase that we normally put in place. Every time we do, we make this announcement, there is probably a movement of revenue from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. And so there's a possibility that there was some acceleration, probably not material, but some acceleration of consumable sales from Q4 into Q3 and anticipation of the price increase. And there is a couple of order things like that that are timing-related. What -- but the macro point is, there is sequential growth. The organic growth rate that we are indicating for total 2021. If you just look at the range from 22% to 25% and it's closer to 25% organic growth, total top-line revenue growth versus last year. Those, those are strong numbers."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Johnson . , guys. Don, you sound pretty optimistic about the implant business in the third quarter, even though that business has been lagging the market. I'd be interested to hear, not just year-over-year when that business might just have been a little pressured a bit last year, but just on how do you feel like you're performing relative to the market in the third quarter? That's ahead of the PrimeTaper launch and just maybe the expectations over the next several quarters for that business?"
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Casey Yeah. Jeff, . On imaging, we had a good quarter and we feel like we've got some pretty good momentum going on in a -- for a number of reasons. I mean, I actually mentioned miss for the first time today. But if you look at our value segment, we are seeing good progress there. Part 1, Part 2 is obviously getting ready for the restage we had spent a ton of time out with KOLs and we feel pretty good that that was starting to have a positive effect. Do I think we're growing exactly at category? I think we're probably a little bit lighter than the category, but as we did the restage, we feel very good that we will have an opportunity to -- I've always said, first, we want to grow, then we want to grow with the category. I think what you saw this quarter is we're growing. And now, with the restructuring and restage, we feel confident that we're going to get -- it's not going to happen tomorrow morning, but we feel in the very foreseeable future, we'll be growing at the category level."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Johnson Yeah. Fair enough. And then I guess we each have to ask our own Byte questions, I apologize for that. But when thinking about that product line, you probably have at least 3 or 4 with some visibility, I would assume, from the time those  test maybe something converts over to a case into revenue in that. So just an y update on fourth quarter, you've probably got 2 out of 3 months in decent visibility at all, that just relative to 3Q, or we continue to see some sequential step-down off 3Q, sequential stability versus 3Q, just any kind of color relative to that third quarter number would be helpful."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez Jeff, I am going to stay away from giving numbers for Q4, but I think we have been pretty transparent with respect to the softness that we saw in Q3 and the fact that because of that softness in Q3, we think there's a chance we're going to miss our $200 million goal for the year, run rate for Byte. So that basically explains what we are seeing right now in -- with Byte."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Johnson Yeah, Jorge and I mean, just just following up on that guy, You're right now at about a 260 to 65 million run rate. Third quarter just kind of continues in the fourth quarter. That at least ballpark kind of how we should be thinking about it."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez I think I've said SureSmile is very much on track to meet or exceed the $100 million run rates and then bites us a little bit behind. So I think ballpark, you're probably close."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Yi Chen  for taking my question. Could you comment on how long you think the supply chain issue can persist and whether you expect the issue to fall both on the manufacturing side and on the logistics side? .
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez Yeah. . . Listen, it' s hard to predict how long the supply chain issues are going to last because, again, this is not something unique to the dental industry, this is impacting pretty much all manufacturing industries globally. So we are a relatively small piece of that big, big equation. We are taking a lot of actions to minimize the impact. Procurement, doing a lot of  work trying to identify new sources for certain components. We are renegotiating certain contracts ensuring that we have access to supply for some key components on a predictable basis. So that's all short-term things that we're doing. I think there are some more long-term solutions that are somewhat related to the supply chain issues, but also related to our desire to be more efficient and improve the margins of our products. So for example, in many cases we are harmonizing certain products or components that we were sourcing for -- from different source -- from multiple sources. We're now trying to consolidate. We're trying to harmonize the design of these components and that should help us improve the reliability of the supply. And then we're trying to make sure that we look at the balancing of our manufacturing operations, ensuring that we have at the right time the right components to ensure that the lines are working efficiently for predictable periods of time as opposed to a stopping and starting based on unpredictable patterns of supply. There's a lot of things going on and the -- like I said before, the supply chain team is doing a  job and that's why so far we have not impacted our ability to manufacture products."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Yi Chen Go it. Do you expect your inventory level to increase in the coming quarters?
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Korinne Wolfmeyer Hi, this is Coreen (ph) on for Jason. s. So first on SureSmile and I guess, the Clear Aligner business more broadly; can you provide for more color on some of your marketing and DTC plans here for the remainder of the year and into next year? What level of investments should we expect here? And if any color there would be helpful."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Casey Sure. On SureSmile, the program that we're running today is about how we see it. We're looking at pulling some different, slightly different levers in SureSmile that will include some DTC, but from an overall P&L construct, nothing radically different about that. On Byte -- Byte, there's a lot of levers. I mean, obviously paid social is a big deal and we obviously follow that very closely, but one of the things we've done since acquiring Byte is really helping them look at search engine optimization and how do you do a better job creating content that's really meaningful to potential customers. We have a very aggressive affiliate marketing program and we continue to have a pretty good program aimed at insurers. So as we think about that, the level of marketing within Byte is -- we don't expect it to change. We've been very d isciplined, like we're not going to go chase unprofitable volume, and that's been a key thing for us. But also the other thing that we're very mindful of, we think it's got a really good runway in front of it. And let's make it less reliant on a single way, paid social and what's broaden its exposure to anybody looking for to do a DTC clear aligner through other means. So again, within the overall construct of both the clear aligner P&L, total franchise P&L, as well as the individual products. We don't see radical changes coming as this quarter or as we look out over the next couple of years."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Korinne Wolfmeyer Helpful. . And then just one last one for us. Can you speak to some of the early impact even seen from activate? I mean, I know it's early, but can you share how many docs have been taken advantage of this program? And is there any pull-through that you've been seeing so far from it?"
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Justin Lane . Just a quick question for me. The high end of organic growth target of 22% to 25% you gave for the full year, I think, implies essentially flat year-over-year growth in Q4, if my math is correct, just trying to understand the puts and takes here. I initially thought it might be something that would be what the softer T&E quarter. Given early orders pulled into Q3, but that doesn't sound like the case based on what you said ea rlier. So any color you can give here will be helpful."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Casey Justin,  for the question. I know, I think are -- if you go to a 25% end of the range, actually from an organic growth perspective, the implied growth would be close to 5%."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Justin Lane Okay. Maybe I could check my math here. And second question for me would just be any update on what you're seeing in other regions outside the U.S., in terms of patient volume and spend. Just trying to think about what you're including in your guidance from a geographic perspective. ."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Jorge Gomez for us. So the -- our expectation in the fourth quarter from a regional standpoint is a continuation of what we saw in Q3.
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Allen Lutz Hi, . This is Allen in for Mike. s. I guess, going to the operating margin and target for '22 at 22%. Can you talk about some of the swing factors there, sort of, rank order? You mentioned investments in SG&A by the implant rebranding, labor supply changes. How should we think about the rank order of those themes? ."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez . I think there is. There needs to be a good contribution from all areas of the P&L to grid cycle and we feel good about all of them. So starting with the top-line, we have certain targets that we want to hit. And we have been explicit about our 4% to 5% target for revenue growth. So that is an important factor. And then keeping a stability from a gross margin perspective, we have been trending very well, very steady from a gross margin perspective. And then there are further opportunities for cost savings both in COGS as well as an SG&A that we are actively pursuing and implementing and a lot of them have to do with what we call our enterprise modernization program that includes a process, harmonization, and centralization. That's something that we still I have a long ways to go. I think there is a tons of opportunities from an automation perspective that should improve our cost base. And then further possibilities to optimize our footprint, both in terms of manufacturing as well as facilities, in general. I think as we learn how to live with the post-pandemic or new ways of doing business post-pandemic, I think there are some interesting ideas to rationalize software footprint as well. So there's tons of things. The last thing I would mention is from a product design perspective. The teams continue to do  work trying to improve the cost of materials, tying to improve the design so that it's ch eaper to manufacture and more efficient overall. So those are all important levers that we are actively pursuing. And when you add all of them together, that's where we feel good about the 22% target."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nathan Rich Hi. . s. Jorge, maybe a high level question. You highlighted a lot of the product opportunities, I guess as we think about going forward, how do you think about maybe investing more aggressively to go after some of those opportunities? You now obviously also have the added dynamic of inflation cost pressures. I guess, has that changed how you're thinking about the historical balance that you've see between reinvesting in the business, but also being on the path to 22% margins? It'd be  to get your sense of how you're thinking about that dynamic as we head into 2022."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez Yes. , Nathan. I don't think our thinking has changed pretty substantially. I think what we're facing right now is reinforcing a lot of the beliefs that we had going into this pandemic. And so that reinforcement is translating into our strong desire to invest more and faster with respect to a lot of ideas that we have in the pipeline, and Don and I have indicated how we are really proud of the increased R&D activity that we have, What is coming out of that work. And we have a number of  ideas that we expect to bring to the market in the near future and they are reflective of some of the important macro trends. Digitazation, changes in behaviors from consumers and things like that. So I think this is just again, reinforcing the ideas we had before and it's just pushing us to move faster and we're really excited about the opportunities, frankly, I mean, is there are  opportunities and we're really excited about trying to do is all of this things faster."
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nathan Rich And then just a very quick follow-up, have you seen -- I think you said something a little bit of it and I just kind of wanted to revisit. Have you seen stock in by the distributors? I know there's a lot of focus on inflation and the price increases that could be coming. Do you feel like inventory levels at all have changed at all with your distribution partners?"
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Jorge Gomez We don't think so. We track that closely and we manage our inventory levels in a disciplined way and so we're not seeing that at this point.
4465541,DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.,XRAY,11/4/2021,CEO Don Casey on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jorge Gomez You're welcome. . This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it's my pleasure to hand the conference over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer, for closing comments and remarks. Yes.  so much. And  for all the time you guys gave us and s as always. Look, I'd summarize by saying. We feel really good about a quarter. It's been doing this a long time. It's rare that you get to talk about a 20% plus organic with a beaten res. And there's some stuff that we're very, very excited about it. Jeff really appreciated the question on implants and when you're seeing double-digit implant growth, something we haven't seen a long time. Are we fee there's tremendous momentum on our T&E business and consumables, which is a question we typically get. We feel that we've innovated across a broad platform. So we feel good about that and I would just pull back a little bit out of the quarter-to-quarter discussion. It was almost 3 years ago to the day when we announced the restructuring. Basically since then, we feel that we're really on track in terms of growth. I mean, if you look at what we did in '19 and then as we get into this, kind of, recovery phase in the pandemic, we were hitting the margin targets that we put out. We already delivered the headcount. We feel very good about the fact that we've created not only a more simple organization, but 1 that's much more functional. And our team in here is really excited about the future. For those of you guys who got to attend DS World, you could kind of see how we're laying things out from a procedure perspective and why we think Dentsply Sirona is really well-positioned to become the essential partner and in terms practices all over the world. I'll close it out, and say  all and look forward to catching up in some of the one-on-one sessions. . Everyone, this concludes our webcast and conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bryan Bergin Hi, . I wanted to ask about the spread between your headcount growth versus revenue growth. It's really widened here, despite the utilization normalizing. Can you talk about some of the key drivers there as well as sustainable level for that difference?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson Yes, I think that we continue to see some improvement in pricing, as I think we've discussed over the last couple of calls. And then probably there's a little bit of shift from a geographic standpoint in different geographies, to have somewhat the higher rate rates associated with them. And so I think you might continue to see some improvement over time. And as I think we've sort of talked about, we feel like we've definitely increased our capacity to add headcount and more specifically to retain headcount. And so we expect that we, we will continue to add headcount at er than historic rates. But currently we're guiding to a somewhat lower increase in headcount in Q4 relative to Q3, based on what we think will be a little bit of slowdown in people joining the company in the month of December."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bryan Bergin Okay. And then just on the growth outlook, so really looks quite broad based across the business. Just any thoughts on how 2022 growth may progress considering the level of comps you continue to put on board here in 21? And, more specifically, how do you feel about headroom to grow in some of your largest clients?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson The demand environment continues to be strong. We see quite a bit of growth from existing clients. We also have a number of engagements that we have entered into more recently that have a lot of growth potential. So that demand environment is obviously quite solid. We also feel that we have increased our ability to support organic growth rates. At the same time, I should say that we don't expect that 36% organic growth rate become a normal sort of multiyear sustainable norm."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bryan Bergin Okay. And the largest accounts, headroom and those, do you still feel strong there?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson Yes, there's definitely there's, there's there's potential in the larger accounts."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jamie Friedman Hi, let me echo the congratulations. Two questions, I was I guess I'll ask him, maybe for Ark. In your prepared remarks Ark you asked -- I mean, you were just discussing experienced consultants, and you use that word experience. I was just wondering, how are you doing? What verticals especially are you drawing talent from with the experience consultants? And then the second thing is Jason, is there any call out about Q4 seasonality or ideally 2022 budgets? ."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Arkadiy Dobkin So the equation I'm sorry, the question about where we take in people where we kind of bring in people from or in what markets we are applying the paper? Because I especially…"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson Yes, I guess I'll answer the second question. So . And from the standpoint of budgets, budgets intact as we sort of execute for clients are looking to invest and continue to, drive digital transformation. So right now it continues to be a market where probably supply constraint is the er issue rather than demand. And we enter 2022, which looks with what looks like a pretty intact demand environment."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Jamie Friedman Got it. I'll drop back in the queue. .
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ashwin Shirvaikar . Congratulations on the quarter. I guess the question and in the past, you guys have spoken about sort of the risk to corporate culture from growing too fast and the ability to grow too fast. So as you scale has that ability changed? Or has your view changed?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Arkadiy Dobkin< /span> Alright, so I think Ashwin I think it’s definitely a very relevant concern. And we are paying a lot of attention to this. At the same time, like things changing from the point of view how we were thinking about general decoration, level of distribution, how people work in just two years ago, so I'm just reminded exactly about kind of our late 80s [ph] sometimes, and we've put during the last couple years and even starting to do before a lot of efforts to make sure that we create an environment from digital ecosystem perspective as well, to see how we can support the culture better in, in what we were thinking will be relevant, probably not during the 2020 2021 but later. It's all accelerated like we always talking about it. But at the same time, that's exactly what Jason already mentioned. We don't believe that it's sustainable to grow as the growth reaches, which is happening right now for a relatively long period of time. So I think it might be better than what we were expecting a couple years ago, when we were talking about our growth 20 plus percent organic growth, maybe it will be better in the future. But it's definitely the rate which we brought in today, because in this case, we will be kind of 50%, 60%, 70% of people who will be new to the company, which is very difficult to sustain culture and quality of the delivery. And we were very, very much focusing on the quality levels."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ashwin Shirvaikar Understood, understood, no. So you focused on the right things as far as that that type of growth is concerned, which is, which is good. I guess, one separate question that goes with Emakina, which I guess that process has been on-going since August. Just to clarify is the acquisition now complete in terms of just the for public share repurchase and stuff like that? And is this an area where you would see yourself continuing to scale in terms of acquiring a lot of local talent in many different geographies?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson And just to clarify, and I think I said that in my prepared remarks, but we've got two months of Emakina results built into the guidance that we communicated for the Q4 quarter."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Maggie Nolan . I'm wondering what is the level of seniority of the employees that you've been hiring so rapidly in the last couple of quarters here and has the pyramid of makeup shifted in the last couple of years?
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Arkadiy Dobkin I think we are definitely doing very specific analysis on this part. And while we are growing faster than we expe cted, we keep inching new at parameter infact right now. So this is kind of short term. We're clearly there's a singularity we bring in more new people. And that's a little bit more challenging. That's kind of related to the previous question is, Ashwin was asking, we are carefully doing this. But again, seniority parameter is supported, as needed for the type of services we deliver."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Maggie Nolan . And then in previous quarters, you've discussed putting through an additional number of price increases compared to prior years. How widespread is this across your client base? And what is the magnitude and how receptive has clients been to these conversations?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson Yes, we continue to have discussions and negotiations with clients around rate increases, some of those are coming in the second half of 2021. At the same time, we're also beginning to have the discussions around rate increases for the beginning of 2022, which is kind of the more traditional period for rate increases. Obviously nobody's likes to absorb a rate increase but I think based on everything that people are seeing from a wage inflation standpoint, from, I guess, a global inflation standpoint, and just the continued strong demand for resources. These are relatively easier conversations than we've had in the past. And I expect that we will see better price increase or rate increase in 2022, than we've seen in previous years."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Maggie Nolan Is that pretty widespread across their client base Jason?
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson Yes. So, every client is probably a little bit different. But yes, I think that, there's a, there will generally be er increases across clients that we've seen in the past. Some clients will have highe r rate increases than others depending on where they've kind of been historically. We are trying to make certain that we are growing our business responsibly, and sort of able to maintain sort of as a stable sort of level of profitability the way we've run the business over the last couple years."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unidentified Analyst Hey, guys, this is Kathy on for Jason,  set of results here. I wanted to ask about margins. I mean, obviously, your margin performance has been very impressive year-to-date. I think you're already tracking to the upper end of your full year guidance range of 17% to 18%. Just curious, is there a reason you didn't take up the full year margin guidance? Is it just conservatism? Or are there other factors that we should be aware of thing?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson Sure. So we believe that the 17% to 18% guidance that we maintained for adjusted income from operations is the appropriate kind of guidance. Q3 was a quite strong quarter, which did some of the profitability improvement was a result of the sort of the upside and revenue that was somewhat unexpected in the quarter. For Q4, we expect that SG&A will come up a little bit between Q3 and Q4 will maintain gross margins kind of in and around the range that we saw in Q3. And then I think the other thing I should point out is that, our recent acquisitions have somewhat lower levels of profit than our traditional EPAM business. So all of those things kind of pushes you more towards a Q4 exit in the middle of that 17% to 18% range. And so that's that's kind of what forms that 17% to 18% guidance for the full year."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unidentified Analyst , very helpful. And just a quick follow up. Just wanted to ask about utilization. Obviously, the Q3 number was mostly came in about two years now. So is that just due to timing of on-boarding, this obviously had a very sharp hiring quarter or, obviously, demand remains very strong. So just wanted to know is there any factors contributing to that thing?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson So utilization in Q3 is traditionally the seasonal low quarter. And so if you think about a world, I guess, pre 2020, it's a time when people go on vacation. And if you're lucky enough to be in Europe, maybe it's a two or three week vacation. And so utilization is relatively low. Last year, when people couldn't leave their homes and countries, we saw higher utilization than is typical. The 77.1% that we saw in Q3 is actually pretty good. And sort of again, sort of seasonally consistent. We expect utilization might come up a little bit in Q4 but not unhappy with the 77.1% that we had in Q3. And I guess the other thing I should point out is no, we usually think about the businesses kind of running in maybe a 77% to 79% utilization. And again, it is somewhat seasonal. There are quarters when we run, at or above 80%. But we generally consider that on the hotter side."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Surinder Thind Hi, Jason. Just I was hoping for a bit more color on your commentary around when you mentioned looking towards a more sustainable growth rate, what you currently generated. Is that c ommentary around the scale which EPAM is currently operating at or is that also some commentary on the industry growth that's occurring and maybe ultimately some expectations of slowdown as we as we look ahead?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson I think it's difficult to comment about the industry as a whole. At this point, we think there is a very strong demand and there is no really sciences is the way to go go down. At the same time from our internal assessment we really would like to make sure that we bring in -- to the clients, and supporting the reputation we should build during previous couple of decades. And from this point of view, we're talking about sustainability of our growth. Because like, if you're going to grow in like 50%, for a couple years, it's, it's our size. We don't believe that it's possible to do in the complexity of the business, we're referring to the complexity of the engagements or so basically, sustainability was referring exactly to, to our understanding what's possible, in reality, with keeping the quality and culture of the company now, similar reply to what we already did to them as well."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Surinder Thind Understood. And then related to the commentary around expectations of strong and demand outlook. As you look over the next X number of years, you made a comment earlier about the negativity of predicting demand about a year ago, and where you thought things were, can you maybe provide some color around what gives you confidence that the current level of demand from an industry perspective is sustainable at these levels? And then if we look at past cycles, it seems like demand, where it's spiked will persist for a couple of years. But then there's generally a quick draw down, any color you can provide their and your conflicts obviously?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson I think our point was exactly how difficult to predict the future and how just couple of years ago, we didn't understand that it would be the turnover, which happened. And even 12 months ago, we saw the impact of pandemic will be different than then just one or two quarters later is changed. And that's why from your question, we do believe that it would be strong demand during the next several years, what would be after this and how this wave will be working? And it's interesting question because everything changes. So unfortunately, I cannot give you the uses kind of assurance for the next decade or so."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"James Faucette  very much. And  for all the detail today. I'm wondering, you mentioned in prepared remarks that you're making some progress on standing up new delivery centers, in different regions. Can you give a little more detail on that? How is hiring going in those regions? And how are you being able to build and, and the EPAM brand which seems to serve to really well to date in your existing geographies?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Arkadiy Dobkin I think you will be very consistent with our comment to the sides. I don't remember in what quarter we were saying that it's easy to breed talent. And I'm pretty sure all of us were confirming that it's also very global. There is no practically spaces in the world today where you can come and start into hire like talent without, without challenges. And I think each quarter is demand is becoming more challenging. At the same time, our investments in education and our recruitment processes, and automation and everything becoming more impactful and allowed us to support what we're doing today. I don't know what else to say. I think war for talent is like in all media, no websites everywhere, like everybody talking about it. And we're pretty proud to this point to be able to sustain the level of net additions which you have in level of kind of relatively manageable attrition rates."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"James Faucette And certainly have good reason to be proud and impressed with what you've done to date on a hiring. You also talked about I just want to talk a little bit of brass quickly on customer growth and contribution. It seemed like there was pretty material sequential growth across your top customers. But how much is that the result of have their own demand versus you turning away, maybe other business and, and so that's resulting in more concentration? And how should we think about that going forward? Do you think we can get far enough ahead of the hiring curve to be able to take on some of that work that maybe you've been turning away recently? Or is that going to be an on-going challenge?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson Yes, so I think that we're actually kind of de-concentrating. What I would say is that, if you looked at that cohort, in the 11, to 20, you did have pretty elevated growth rates in that cohort. And maybe some of that speaks to sort of the trends we're seeing in the market. So you've got a few clients, one in the asset management space, that was probably somewhat unprepared for that the new digital kind of operating world, the pandemic, sort of encouraged them to make investments, and now there's a significant amount of investment around updating their infrastructure and the way they connect with their end clients. And so you've got, I would say, a number of companies who probably got additional religion, the via the pandemic, and you are seeing quite accelerated investment. And then EPAM continues to bring that sort of trusted partner to the table. And so, clients who are looking to make certain that their transformation journey is successful, oftentimes are working with EPAM, because of the track record that Arkadiy have spoken about. So we did see some really strong growth in the 11 through 20. But we're also seeing very strong growth in the customers below 20. I would say, probably, if you're an existing customer with strong demand, you probably have a little bit more of a say at the table. And so probably they are getting a little bit more their share of resources in brand new customers. And again, we continue to be constrained by supply and are expecting that, we'll continu e to have very, very solid net additions in Q4, but at a somewhat lower level than in Q3, okay. And of course, that excludes the 1100 additions coming through in Emakina. So I said a lot. Was that relatively clear or?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"James Faucette Yes, that was that was perfect. Just the one clarification that and I think you touched on this in terms of the lower net addition in the fourth quarter. Do you think that is that seasonal or is there some other aspects that are impacting that?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson I mean, I think generally, what we're thinking is that December is a time when most people don't change jobs. And so we'll have maybe fewer joiners in December. But it might be a reflection that things could get a little bit harder over time. But, as Ark just talked about, we've really improved our capability to attract. I think our hiring brand continues to improve quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. We've also improved our ability to staff projects and to match supply and demand. So I think that we've improved our capabilities around organic growth rates. But, again, are expecting a somewhat slower level of net additions in Q4."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arvind Ramnani Hey, congrats on a terrific quarter. I just want to go back to a comment Ark made in the prepared remarks in talking about kind of pushing into new areas and capabilities. So, a couple of questions around this, what are you doing in terms of figuring out which areas to invest in,  just given the breadth of tech innovation kind of across the space, which areas -- how are you deciding which areas to really kind of focus on and, and build capabilities in before there's commercial, or revenue opportunity? And the second question is, how are you deciding what areas to, to kind of de-emphasize, are they are there certain areas where you're, you don't see much growth? How are you deciding what areas to say, like, we're going to focus less on these areas?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Arkadiy Dobkin Yes, like, I appreciate your questions, like, all the stress, trying to understand the future and how are we doing this? And so like, what simple solid question which like, really complex. I just would like to remind like, I'm not going to go to specific topics, but we do believe that one of the advantages which we feel that around, probably 30% or 40% of our business is still working with software companies and technology companies and platform companies. And we're doing significant kinds of sometimes significant portion of the development of new products and platform for this type of clients, which is giving us like very different exposure to what's happening in different areas, like sometimes we do a new product, or new concept like wide shoulders and is going to the market, but then we are forced to help this type of clients to do implementation of this. So we have kind of organic internal barometer if you will, to help us to select some areas, and we build this capability sometimes in very organic. [Technical difficulty] quick, and as we designed, we trying to keep this proportion of this of such clients in our in our business portfolio to be able to continuously do business. This is from technology standpoint. And then from end to end solutions don't quit. We definitely is everything what we were sharing about consultancy. We're going up and up in the chain and expand in our business perspective of what we building and how we can help clients. And first consulting was for us [Indiscernible] technologies, and we added experience components. And we were talking about business now, talking about strategy in my keynote part of this but we also did couple more positions in this area. And this is when we're talking about new areas. It's not only about new technologies, it's also was the whole end to end story."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arvind Ramnani Perfect, perfect. Another question, certainly in the last few years, we have expanded our consulting capabilities, which makes a lot more sense. Given that now you're doing close to a billion dollars in revenue per quarter. Can you just talk maybe about the competitive set who are you winning business from? Are you is -- a competitive set changed now versus three, four years back?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Arkadiy Dobkin I think you understand our competitive base very, very well. And I think we just get in proportionally more to the situation when consultant becomes much, much more important part to start the business to open the door. From this point of view, I think we see the difference from general competitive on kind of what exactly companies we compete against. I think it's largely the same because most of the large vendors had these capabilities before. We’re just trying to bring different values through integrating better with delivery and generic."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arvind Ramnani Perfect, , and good luck for rest of the year."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Enders Okay, .  for  for taking my question. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the macron kind of where budgets are at this point. Good to see, I guess travel and consumer specifically, recovery here. But are you still seeing some of that depressed funding levels from COVID? So I've been across some of the verticals in your client base."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Arkadiy Dobkin I don't believe we see any of this exists at th is stage. I’ve seen practically and it's not only about rolling consumers, it’s practically about all indices. We do believe that everybody understand that preparation for something new or even like changes which this pandemic trigger splitting constant. And when I was saying before, like it's difficult to predict what would be two years or three years from now, it is difficult and anything can happen and we all understand it. But mostly I was referring to level of demand which is happening specifically right now. The level which was seeing and prediction for longer term like before pandemic I think is definitely will be there for longer term as well. So but direct answer to your equation, no we don't see any type of sign of partial depression still from the pandemic right now as a market, in our market."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Enders Okay perfect. I guess as a follow up, just as you kind of think about the biggest challenges that you are now trying to solve for today is still the biggest thing, the ability to bring in more talent. And we're just going to kind of gross margin were that that today is the disability to bring in talent and pass on some of the some of the costs there and deal with the higher hiring levels or kind of what's the biggest challenge here you're still solving for today?"
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Peterson And I'm going to step in and kind of respond to that sort of more tactical question on gross margin. So we talked about earlier in this call that we do continue to see elevated wage inflation. We are getting somewhat better increases in rates, okay, but probably not fully able to offset wage inflation, wherever the one important point is, this year, we've had our performances, I think you've seen as we've taken apart guidance, I think every quarter. And so we have a variable compensation element that is the expense is based on the strength of the company's performance and revenue growth and profitability. So we're, you're booking the expense associate with variable compensation at a much, much higher level this year than we have in past years. So next year, you think that that, I would think that would normalize. And so that will have a positive impact on gross margin. And then you may continue to have some pressure with wage inflation and, hopefully those two kind of offset each other. And just to sort of round it out, the variable compensation expense shows up throughout the year and that is generally paid in the form of a variable payout to employees in at the end of Q1 quarter and the beginning of the Q2 quarter."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vladimir Bespalov Hello, congratulations on very good number. And  for taking my question. I would like to ask you about your M&A pipeline and -- of the M&A market since Ark mentioned that this is a part of your strategy going forward and important part. So do you feel like the competition on this market is growing? Because there have been a lot of activity in the sector in general? Do you feel like the that it's getting more and more difficult to find the proper targets the valuations are going up and things like this, so could you provide some color? ."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Arkadiy Dobkin I think it's definitely known fact as the answer will be yes, yes, and yes and so basically there are a lot of companies on the market, but competition is growing and price is growing as well. So that's very natural in the markets situation which you described. And we still go into to find the right companies to, to bring on board and to improve our capabilities. So we like everybody else to a number opportunities right now."
4465545,"EPAM Systems, Inc.",EPAM,11/4/2021,CEO Arkadiy Dobkin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Arkadiy Dobkin Yes, absolutely. . I would now like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks. As always,  very much for attending the call today. You know that if you have any equations days, data is available and again, see you in three months.  very much. This concludes today’s conference call.  for participating. You may now disconnect."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shahriar Pourreza Someone. Just couple of questions on 951, obviously it's good, it finally got done in a bipartisan way. Obviously 22 is going to be busy and you do have some good amount of what to chop, though it's a really good framework. Remind us on next steps, especially as we're thinking about the rule-making, securitization, and the carbon reduction plan."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good Sure. Shahriar . And we're pleased that the leaders of the state came together in this bipartisan way to provide the framework that we are going to be talking about. And in many ways, it's the combination of the process we've discussed with you over the last several years as we've worked toward this clean energy transition. The next step, which is already underway, is rule making around the performance-based rate making and securitization. The commission has outlined a process that should culminate in February for PBR and an April for securitization. And then we would also expect the commission to establish procedures around the shaping of the Carbon Reduction Plan. That is not yet out, but we would expect it to occur as you know, the timeline for that is December of 2022. So a lot of work will go on as this legislation transitions into the regulatory arena. We will be involved, of course, stakeholders will be involved, and on the carbon reduction plans, South Carolina will be a very important stakeholder at the table every step of the way. And so we'll be anxious to provide updates along the way as we reach those milestones. But I feel like this is a very good process to put us on a path to achieve not only our carbon reduction goals, but meaningful investments that will drive returns over this decade and beyond."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shahriar Pourreza Got it. And Lynn, lastly, I want to tease it out a bit of your -- prepared comments around the growth guide as we're thinking about various drivers at the legislation and now it impacts your plan. You obviously have more regulated renewable opportunities. You should theoretically have less lag and more opportunities to increase and accelerate capex as the plan further cements, right? You obviously have opportunities around PBR and sharing mechanisms. So if you were solidly within your 5% to 7% growth rate without legislation, especially with an improving load backdrop as Steve clearly highlighted, how can the legislation, I guess not be accretive to your current guide from an EPS growth standpoint?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good Sure. I appreciate the question and I think we should broaden it really beyond the Carolinas to also note the progress that we expect to make another jurisdictions. We have important IRP filing coming up in November, end of this month in Indiana, which will Is that a pace for the transition. So taking all of those things together, we do see increased capital. And as we open up 2026 and establish a 5-year range, we believe that capital will go to 60 to 65 as we look at the back half of the decade w e had shared 65 to 75. We think it's more likely to be in that top half, 70 to 75. And so we do believe we have the potential over time to earn at the top end of our 5% to 7% range, the top half that 5% to 7% range. And so we have some work to do with rulemaking and beginning the execution. But we have a long runway of capital investment and this regulatory modernization will be helpful, not only to align investments with benefits to customers, but also to allow us to more effectively put capital to work and deliver returns."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd Perfect. I appreciate it.  so much, Lynn. See you soon."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Lynn Good . And next we'll hear from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd I wanted to just maybe build a little bit on the prior questions in terms of just federal legislation supporting renewable energy in a number of ways. And both -- I guess, I'm thinking specifically in North Carolina, as well as Indiana. In Indiana [Indiscernible] you have a resource filing by the end of this month. And then in North Carolina though, it does feel like the deliberation around the cadence of decarbonization is going to flow well into 2022. And to the extent that this legislation does pass, as it extends support for solar and wind, provides support for storage, how might that impact the thinking, not just for you, but for other stakeholders in both of those states?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good I believe there's a lot of conversation going on. Steven in both Indiana, in Florida, in the Carolinas around the clean energy transition. And that has been building over the last several years and so you see increasing opport unities for renewable investment, for storage investment, energy efficiency, demand response investment will be a part of it. In some of our states also, a keen interest in getting a base amount of electric vehicle infrastructure in place. And so I do believe the momentum is picking up, of course, all states are watching what's going on at the federal level. And the tax incentives, in particular, can be additive to our progress in the states. And so I see a  deal of alignment between what we are trying to accomplish, where our states are going, and the discussions that are underway in Washington."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd That's helpful and to the extent that we do see this level of support from federal legislation, could that potentially lead to kind of a further acceleration? I wouldn't imagine anytime soon for your capital plan, but kind of later in the decade. It's obviously an impressive amount of capex that you have. But could this essentially result in an acceleration? Or -- I know that's very tough to predict, but how might that impact your longer-term capital spend levels?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good Steve, and I certainly think it can result in acceleration. And that gets down to the target and the timeline that's being established. And I know a lot of debate will occur around those 2 items. Affordability is another factor that we need to keep into the equation. And we have affordability, reliability kind of top of mind as we pursue these goals. But I do believe transition of the bulk power system, both generation and grid is underway with a lot of tailwinds behind it. And we are trying to proceed in a way that works for our states, our customers, the economy. But along the way, importantly, it will deliver meaningful investments for our investors. And so I do see just a long runway of investment opportunity operating and in all of these states, driven by both state and federal tailwinds."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd Good. Very clear. Understood. And then maybe just one other element of the legislation is the -- we're interested in is the minimum tax levels that are in the bill. How might that impact both through your cash flow, customer bill impacts, credit statistics, things like that, to the extent that the utility sector doesn't get exempted from that particular provision? What's your sort of latest thinking around the impacts there?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Young I would agree with that. We would view it as a timing issue. And then there's other provisions. They are extension of other credits, direct pay of credits, and inclusion of nuclear PTCs that -- particularly for Duke with our nuclear fleet. That help mitigate any impacts of this to customers."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Stephen Byrd That's a good point. There are other provisions that sort of pushing the other direction and provide a benefit. Understood. That's all I had. .
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Arnold Hey. I just wanted to pick up on -- you just mentioned the nuclear PTC. Steve, I was curious whether you guys have any sense of yet how you would derive -- define the revenues that would sort of interact with the PTC calculation for you on regulated nukes."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good Jonathan, I'll take that. This is a pretty dynamic area and we're yet this morning coming through what came out of the house last night, a couple of thousand pages. We do believe it will apply to regulated nuclear. We do believe that it'll apply for a 6-year period but we're anxious to learn more and study this a bit more. So at this stage of the game, we're talking more about -- we believe regulating nuclear is included, but more to come on how all of these elements fit together."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Arnold And just staying with that, with nuclear. One element of HB 951, [Indiscernible] interesting was that you could have a little extra time, if you're pursuing a small modular or I guess nuclear project, or offshore wind. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about how some solutions will be part of what you put forth, and what the time frame might be best guess at the moment on both?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good Sure. And you know, Jonathan, if you think back to the scenarios that we put forward in the 2020 IRP, there were a couple of scenarios that got to that 70% level. One included offshore wind, the other included advanced nuclear small modular reactor. We do see a need over time to put in some of these next-generation, although offshore wind very mature in Europe, not as much here in the U.S., but these c lean energy technologies. And so I believe this will be an important discussion as the carbon reduction plan is developed, and we will go into that engaging with our regulators, policymakers, communities, to come up with a thoughtful approach on how to incorporate these technologies. And so I think more to come on that as this carbon reduction plan begins to take shape in '22."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Lynn Good . And next we'll hear from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Hey. So Okay. So perhaps just to come back to the 70% piece, obviously, well done on getting the legislation done, I'm curious if you can be more --"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- specific about -- indeed, absolutely. I know it's been a long ride so we're finally here. To that point though, when you're thinking about the top half here of the 65 and 75, what are the specific moving pieces that you're thinking about that gets you there? What are the debate points around the 70%? I know you touched earlier about balancing bill headroom against perhaps various other considerations, but if we can talk more changeably about different scenarios or different combinations, if you will, I'm just trying to understand how you get to that upper end, if you will, in terms of the incremental requirement."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good Julien, I think the best thing I could point you to at this point is back to the IRPs. And if you look at the volume of solar and storage, the level of coal retirements, the additional resources that will be added to maintain reliability. As you move towards 70% carbon reduction, there are megawatts. And so that's what we are looking at. And this will be important as we go through the carbon reduction planning process commission, of course setting that procedural schedule. There will be a lot of opportunities for discussion, stakeholder in South Carolina at the table. But I would point you back to those IRP because I think that's probably the best place to really begin thinking about the magnitude of the transition."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Yeah. And if I understand those IRP scenarios. Again, I know these things are influx. The 2 specific scenarios that got you there. 1. Included our pathway for offshore and the other one included SMRs. Is it fair right now to think that your bias in favor of offshore, given what we're seeing already across the space or is SMR really kind of one of the key pathways that you're thinking about?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good I would say it's too early to tell. We will n ot unilaterally make a decision. Julien on what technology makes sense for our customers in the states in which we operate. So we believe continued discussion engagement with the regulators, policymakers, communities will be important to this decision. We are evaluating offshore wind. I think you may have noticed there was a proposed sale notice issued for a lease off the coast of North Carolina. The Kitty Hawk lease area is also there. So I would just say it's -- there's more to come here. And as this carbon reduction plan begins to take shape, we'll have an opportunity to further these stakeholder discussions to develop the plan that makes sense for our customers in the states in which we operate."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. Yeah. I hear what you're saying. And nothing more specific yet on a definitive timeline on IRP for Indiana in terms of exit from coal, etc. I know that some of your peers have already kind of made broad statements on that front, but that -- we got to wait here, so."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good Well, and Julien, I would say it's about 3 weeks away, so the filing is November 30th and as you know, we have been working on reducing the useful life of coal. We did so in connection with the rate cases that were finalized last year. And we will continue to work on coal retirements, diversification, adding renewables, so you can expect to see more at the end of this month on Indiana. And we're actively engaged in the Stakeholder process there, as this work continues."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith All right, well, best of luck with those finals weeks. And we'll see you soon."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Lynn Good . And next we'll hear from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan -- well, actually it's Ryan. On for Jeremy. Sorry."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Just wondering, you hit on the SEEM proposal that was approved at FERC, we wanted you to give a bit more color on opportunities that come out of that in terms of your renewable's distribution [Indiscernible] transmission of opportunities."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good You know, Ryan, I would think about the same as a very customer-focused initiative. And we've had a lot of work done with outside parties to look at the potential and we believe annually customers would save in the range of 40 to 50 million in the near term and up to a 100 and 150 million over the longer term. So we see it as a way that provides er visibility around the operation of the Southeastern grid and gives us the opportunity to integrate more renewables. So that's how I would think about it here in the near term. And we think it represents a  opportunity to continue to mature the renewable investment here in the Southeast."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Understood. And then, I'll just ask one on thinking, understand where you get the kind of the full, kind of drivers in 2022 on the year-end call. But the some of the strong load trends you've seen this year and then also, you're kind of a slog ability to take out of the business. How you kind of make at this stage on some of those different drivers into 2022 as you kind of mentioned it being maybe a bridge year, into kind of the capital ramp for 2023 and beyond?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good In a rate case activity, Ryan, I was just looking at this slide, Ohio Electric Distribution, Piedmont, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, so here is a rate case activity also, I would point to."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Ryan Got it. Makes sense. I appreciate the color. .
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good . And next, we'll hear from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman . . Hope you're well. So, I have to ask since no one else did, the -- there was a Press report or week or two ago about there being maybe being a settlement soon with Elliott investments. Could you comment on that? And if there's any status of that situation."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good And Steve, I'm not going to comment on the press report, but what I will say is we remain in very constructive conversations with Elliott. We are open to a constructive settlement and as I've said many times, our decision process around this will center on terms that we believe are in the best interest of our shareholders and our Company. But constructive conversations continue."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman Okay. . And just in North Carolina, the -- in terms of actually filing another rate case to recover investment, I guess the next one would be under this law, with maybe performance base, when would that be? And is there any time lag issues before you are able to kind of get to that?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good Steve, we are evaluating when the appropriate time is for a rate case, as we always do, you point to something that is certainly a consideration. Its rule making process will continue into 2022 and evaluating the timing for a rate case that not only would contemplate that rule making, but also reflect capital investment is work that's underway. And as we have a better sense of that, we will update you. But some work to do, I guess around this rulemaking that I referenced before, we would file under that plan."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Steve Fleishman Okay. So is it not clear right now whether the next rate case would be with the new performance-based or maybe you do a case first without that?
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good That's an interesting question and depending on the timing of the rule-making, I think it would be good to try to reflect that in the rate filing. Right now, the commission is on target for rule making for PBR by February. That's an aggressive time frame. I know there's a lot of work to do, but to pick up PBR within the rate case would certainly be an objective if the timing works out."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good . We've lost our Operator. April, are you there? you there? I'm sorry. Our final question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Lapides Hi Lynn, and  for taking my question. Hey, just curious, when I think about HB 951, the language was pretty clear about on the core retirement securitization being for just the sub-critical units. How should we think about what happens to the supercritical units? The larger kind of bigger component of the Duke Carolinas and Duke Progress fleet over time and whether how you would deal if there were early retirements of those units?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good I would think about traditional rate-making on those, Michael. And some of the units will have dual-fuel capability, so they will continue running on natural gas for a period of time. So I would think about that way."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Lapides Got it. And then one follow-on related to 951. I'm just curious, I don't think the offshore wind components made it into the bill. You've talked a little bit about offshore wind than SMRs. How do you -- is the concern, the reason it got left out of the bill more of [Indiscernible] -cost, or were there other concerns that were driving that?"
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good I wouldn't regard it as being left out of the bill but I would regard it as those decisions around clean technologies will be part of the carbon reduction plan and overseen by the Commission, where they will also be evaluating affordability and reliability. So I think more to come on it, Michael, and what technologies will be necessary to hit these goals, and what works for the states, which technologies make the most sense for our policymakers and communities."
4465549,Duke Energy Corporation,DUK,11/4/2021,CEO Lynn Good on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lynn Good All right. April, I'll take it from here. I want to thank everyone for participating today. I know we have a chance to see many if there all of you next week at EEI. So we look forward to continuing the conversation and IR, of course, is always available if there are questions following this call. So  again for your investment. And that does conclude today's conference.  all for your participation. You may now disconnect."
4465551,"Corteva, Inc.",CTVA,11/4/2021,CEO Chuck Magro on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vincent Andrews Chuck, you have a very unique vantage point on this coming from coming from nutrient and obviously being one of the largest agri retailers and you competed with Corteva on the seed side of the equation. You had level end and you competed with everybody on your proprietary products over there. So, you highlighted everything that you thought was the strengths of the Company, but where do you come into this with from the outside as a prior competitor thinking that there's some things that you need to firm up or some things that could be done a bit better that differently or were some blind spots are that you need advantage point on that you come into the organization and  really hit the ground running with?"
4465551,"Corteva, Inc.",CTVA,11/4/2021,CEO Chuck Magro on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joel Jackson Hey, Chuck. Chuck, we think the Chinese product contract is going to sell out. No, I'm just kidding. But seriously, you've moved from one part of the industry to another part of the industry. And you put out this slide deck on day 3 on the job, fair enough. But I want to know these are targets at Corteva had for some time for 2022, you call them initial planning framework, cleaning and planning framework would ever want to call them. But Chuck, you're probably going to be judged on whether you hit these numbers next year. And so, I have to believe you must have had a lot of comfort level that you can hit at least the midpoint of its guidance range with maybe some cushion above it to want to own these numbers. Can you specifically as possible talk about that and your confidence that you can hit those numbers?"
4465551,"Corteva, Inc.",CTVA,11/4/2021,CEO Chuck Magro on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Chuck Magro Fair, Joel. Nice to hear your voice again. Look, so the management -- I have confidence in the management team. I'll tell you that right now. The team did reaffirm the outlook, I was certainly involved in that. And I will tell you that there is a lot of focus across the Company throughout the world on those -- on the outlook numbers. And it is only day 4, I'll just remind you. I will plan to dig in on the fundamental assumptions from the ground up. Obviously, I haven't had time to do that, but I will say a couple of things. There is a lot of potential in this Company. There a lot of catalyst and leavers that are within the management teams control and that they are highly focused on, which will drive long-term value creation for shareholders. The other thing is look, we believe that the agricultural backdrop is still going to be quite positive as we enter 2022, we've got good planted acreage we expect in corn and soybeans next year, we're going to see increased acreage in Brazil. I think that when we look at farmer economics, they are still very constructive. Your potash question, I'm going to keep to the side. But overall, we think that the backdrop for the egg markets are quite positive. And then if you look at what Corteva can do within it to control in terms of price,"

You mentioned growth from biological. And Chuck, you briefly touched on our growth engine. You mentioned 17 new launches in '21 and '22, how big is this business for you?

First on the financial side, you increased your free cash flow guidance $300 million on the low-end to $550 million. Can you talk through the drivers of that presumably working capital played a role and I'd be interested to know how much you view as structural versus transitory. And then secondly, on the fundamental side, one of your competitors has been quite vocal about short stature corn. Be interested to hear your thoughts on that subject and whether that might play a role for Corteva in the future."

So, on the cash flow, you'll recall, you may have referenced the previous cash map operation slide that we had or guide rather that we had of 12 to 16. We're now at 17 to 19. So reflects a couple of things, I think number 1, as you know, we have focused a lot on basic operational disciplines around [Indiscernible] cash and particularly on working capital. So, there's a portion of this, back to your structural, it's really related to that in both --"

Those are 2 areas we've really been working on and deploying talent and the right disciplines and systems to support that, so those are important contributors. We've also increased the amount of prepaid assumption just in terms of the liquidity that our customers have. And just what we're seeing already in terms of cash coming in related to that. So, you could say that it's more -- call it temporary as opposed to structural. We've also got some improvement in terms of net income with the lower tax rate that we've guided to. And that's part of, as you know, our EPS"

As we head into '22, you just said are a little bit on this. But could you just further comments on regional CP pricing. The potential for incremental contributions for new product volume after a strong 21 performance thus far. And then also just spin-offs and momentum. So just any regional color I would be appreciated on this factors.  so much."

4465551,"Corteva, Inc.",CTVA,11/4/2021,CEO Chuck Magro on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Zekauskas I was wondering if you can speak about the [Indiscernible], the E3 being launched in Brazil like that holler ramp up of that might look like. I guess probably very small for the additional growing season, but I was running if you look 2 or 3 years out. How many acres do you think you might achieve? And secondly, I was wondering, I can also like one more time as cost price issue for 2022. So, in general, like the outlook that you have for 2022, to me doesn't look that [Indiscernible] Like if you can have with its 3 or 4 or 5% price increases on sales of 15 and a half billion, like that should offset what were all of your costs. And so, having EBITDA growth in 2022 shouldn't be that difficult despite all of the cost headwinds. What do you see a different than tha t? Because I see a much more optimistic than I hear in your voice. ."

So over time, no doubt this technology is going to drive incremental growth for us. It's going to ly enhance our competitive position in the Latin America soybean market, which is important for us and we're excited to bring new choice to the marketplace. And the marketplace is excited to have a new choice in terms of technology as well. And then overtime, we are also going to introduce this in other markets, such as Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. So, it is something very important. We have not sized what we see the adoption rate as at this point in time, but understand it's a limited launch and it really is about establishing that technology and gaining support from our customers."

As you said, and Chuck, really, I think articulated it well. It's really constructive setup when you look at 2022 with the backdrop of our markets. And the strength of what we're bringing, continue to bring to the market. And as you said, on price, we continue to execute against our strategy of pricing. Both Rajan and Tim have spoken about that, spoken to some of the specifics.

Got a follow-up for you, Tim, and that is about your seed orders for 2022 in the U.S. Where would you position them that right now? Are you close to having half of those orders in given where we are in the harvest? And any trends that you can comment on whether there is a mix shift in germplasm or trades, or perhaps even a mix shift in acreage between corn and soybeans."

On Crop Protection pricing, it ranges from flat in Asia-Pacific to 5% in Latin America. Does that basically track where the new products are having the most impact or is there something else behind the range in pricing, like the bundling rebates would seats."

Hi, I was just wondering if you could give us an update in terms of your Enlist platform, in terms of what percentage of your Enlist sales next year are going to come from your own germplasm and how broad, I guess your scope is going to be geographically. I was specifically wondering about the Southern U.S. and that market for unless next year as well. ."

Good to speak with you again, looking forward to seeing you on Monday. You mentioned that your second priority was on the sustainability front and during the quarter. Corteva announced that their day-to-day carbon capture initiatives joint venture with Indigo. And I was wondering if perhaps someone on the team can talk about what the financial ramifications of this are? How does it fit into your current product offerings and any sort of initial feedback that you've received from this?"
4465551,"Corteva, Inc.",CTVA,11/4/2021,CEO Chuck Magro on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rajan Gajaria Hi Frank. This is Rajan, I'll take that. I believe this is related to the whole value capture from a carbon perspective, but we're really excited about the relationship that we have gotten within Indigo. We had a pilot program plan for getting 200,000 acres this year. And we are going to exceed that. But as you think about sustainability and as we think about ways the whole value proposition for farmers is going to go. It's too early to say this is what the price of carbon is going to be. And that rea lly is going to be one of the biggest assumptions that there is. But the technology that Corteva brings from a digital standpoint. will help to make sure that we are tracking the behaviors that the farmers are going to change. The partnership with Indego brings capabilities that they have in terms of measuring the actual impact and get all this validated with third-party bodies in there. So, we're really excited about the possibilities and creating more of opportunities for a farmer customers to get additional revenue. Too early to comment on what the financial impact of that is, given the infancy of where we are trend. And our last question will come from Alexi Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets."

4465551,"Corteva, Inc.",CTVA,11/4/2021,CEO Chuck Magro on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rajan Gajaria Yes. Hi, this is Rajan. I think taking a step back, we'll talk about our seed neutrality journey, we will con tinue to be on track for that. The seed royalty reduction in 2022 will be in the similar ballpark to what we have done in 2021. Give or take around $50 million. But the important thing is that, all the element in-play for us to continue to work with the royalty reduction. Are there of which is the Enlist adoption that we have been talking about is a big part of it. So that's how we look at royalties for 2022. And now I will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Rudolph, at this time, I'll turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks. . We appreciate everyone joining the call today. And again,  for your interest in Corteva. Have a  and safe day. . This concludes today's call.  for your participation. You may now disconnect."

4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate Some companies can give me some problems. John, I'm going to start with Egypt if I may. I'm sure you saw the report we put out a month or so ago. One of your smaller peers has been a little bit more transparent on the potential changes in terms from the PSC modernization. So one of those conceptually, you could walk us through how are you see the moving parts as it relates to increased profit oil and in particular, the potential for legacy stranded capital cost recovery. If you could put some maybe a range of potential impacts on your assuming similar terms applied."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney Yeah. Doug, the thing I would add to th at, based on your work, you've demonstrated, you understand how the PSC's work. The backlog -- while we haven't indicated exactly how much that is, the mechanism to recover that, is that it is the backlog would be -- and we've shared this publicly already. The backlog would be recovered over a 5 year period on a quarterly basis. And that backlog would roll into the other costs for cost recovery. So it is all subject -- to sum of all of that, is subject to the 40% limit on cost recovery barrels. the benefit -- the real benefit as you've noted in your right out is that by aggregating all of these into a single bucket for cost recovery purposes, you don't end up with stranded costs in any of the smaller buckets and that will allow us to get this backlog of cost recovered as well especially in this price environment."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate Steve, I know you don't want to give specifics, but end my -- my note I did suggest the potential of the impact could be several $100 million across would you push back on that or give some affirmation that we're in the ballpark?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney Yeah, Doug. I think I need to be really careful about that. So I think we won't comment on it at this point in time."

Let me move on very quickly to my second question, which is understandably Suriname. You've got a well test, I guess you drilled out the fox about 3.5 weeks ago. John, I guess I'm a little surprised that you're not ready to give us some updates there or on Bonboni, where our guys on the ground are suggesting that you'd already in the formation era. So I'm just wondering if you can offer any color around those 2 pieces of potential news flow that we expect, I guess in the coming months, now we get there. ."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Christmann . I'll address Sahakara Sal South first. Number 1 you can appreciate that there's multiple phases of a flow test that you go through and sometimes even more important than the flow period is the buildup and the pressure response and all of those things. So it's early. I will just tell you save your question. I'm not in a position to reveal anything on it today, but hold your the question and we'll be able to respond in the near future. So is returned to Bonboni? Yes, there's Total's got two rigs, the developers of Sapakara South. The value in is at Bonboni I will remind everybody it's 45 kilometer step-out to the North, It is a key well. And I think the prospectivity up there will -- will inform the Northern portion of the block, as well as have some implications on Block 53. So once again, I'm not in a position to provide any update but I would just stay tuned, right? So and we'll be in a position to update you when we can."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neal Dingmann Hello, John. Nice update on the shareholder return. I was just going to add one thing around that. Just your thought -- I don't know. Either you're the Company's for personal thoughts on something about doing more of a variable versus buyback. And obviously your stock appears to me on many levels quite cheap here. So I'm just wondering how you think about the two alternatives."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney Yeah. Only on the [Indiscernible] that.  because I think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we've rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we've been. I think if you just step back and think about the industry, it wasn't too long ago that the industry was all about growth and really, little or no returns to shareholders. More recently, we've finally gotten to where it's about moderated growth ambitions and really starting to roll out these returns frameworks. And I think the big step right now is to figure out well, what's the right return framework? And I'd say it's early days for the industry in general and we're all figuring that out now that returns frameworks right now are migrating towards a percent of free cash flow and I think that's probably good. Ranges out there pretty broad. I see ranges from 25% all the way up to 75%. We're probably going to find a sweet spot in there. And I think it's starting to migrate towards somewhere around 50% as an industry for APA specifically. I mean, we just took a significant step in improving the capital structure of the Company with the debt tender this fall and that was a 100% focused on debt reduction. We know there's more to do on the Balance Sheet and we'll get to that. But to be clear, we still want to get to investment-grade, that can take some time and that's okay. We do have to just recognize that, shareholders are pretty important too and we need to find a balance in returns to share holders, while at the same time continuing to improve the Balance Sheet. And the industry has chosen 50%, because they're kind of migrating towards that. We chose 60%. We think this is the right balance, or ACA. We have a quality diversified portfolio. It's exposed to a good  range of commodity price and geographic mix. It's capable of sustaining free cash flow for many many years. And remember free cash flow, the basis for the return's circulation is after capital spending. We've been improving the Balance Sheet. We can still continue to strengthen the Balance Sheet up to 40%. Still available for other uses including debt reduction, but I'd say in the near-term, we certainly have a bias for dividends and buybacks. And remember also we did talk about, in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we're going to probably pick up the pace on non-core asset sales and that's also a source of funds for continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, but also for potentially for more returns to shareholders as well. So we feel pretty good about that balance and the 60% level. As John indicated, we don't -- we're not particular fans of the variable dividends at this point in time. We will consider -- will keep -- we'll continue to look at that for the future and consider how the market reacts to those. I think the variable dividend needs to be in general, a smaller piece. And just in terms of balancing dividends versus buybacks, for now we're just happy to lean into buybacks. We believe our share price is too low. We've been discounting for several months now er than 25% free cash flow yield, one of the highest in the peer group. We don't believe our base cash flow generating capacity is actually fully appreciated by the market. And we need to continue to work on that. We know that. But for now the share price is just too low, so we will continue with leaning in on the buybacks. We know we need to have a competitive ordinary dividend yield. And it needs to be competitive against other E&P s as well as the broader market. And I think that's probably higher than what we see is the typical 2% ordinary dividend yield we see today. And we'll figure that out and it's about getting to a balance around what's the right strength of Balance Sheet that certainly is spending to something stronger. But also what price are we going to base all of that on, because I think it's a valid question is to what we all think mid-cycle price is now. We'll get on with raising the dividend as well. We just need to be thoughtful about that. It was only 18 months ago that we cut the dividend by 90% and that was a pretty painful process. We're going to make sure we don't put ourselves in a situation where we have to do something like that again. Probably more than you added for, but I wanted to take the opportunity to lay out a lot of context around the returns framework."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neal Dingmann No, I appreciate. I think what you said about the -- both said about the Total return makes a lot of -- or about the shared buybacks makes sense. And one just quick follow-up, John, just thoughts on future of, I'd say near-term, medium-term Alpine High activity given not only the strong natural gas prices post the Altice deal and even that Schneer long-term supply contract agreement seems to be get you closer to fruition. So given all that, maybe what you could say about Alpine High."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Christmann When you look at our U.S. program, we've got 2 rigs in the southern Midland Basin. We picked up another 1 that's in the Chalk now. We've indicated we will be adding another rig, probably middle of next year, which will put us 3 that will go to Permian. And quite frankly then we envision those rigs working those assets in tandem. We're in pad drilling. You will be seeing those move. And what the time it takes on the unconventional side to mobilize a rig, drill pads, and see production. Your short-term windows are benefiting from those right now at Alpine High with the dokcs that we did earlier, right? So I think you're going to see our very well thought out efficient capital program in the U.S., where we're moving those rigs around those place based on the, how we've laid the inventory out in the infrastructure, so we can maximize those returns. But there is a portion of the Altice piece if we sell the -- sell down shares that we do put in there, but it will all fit into our framework. So it's nice to have quality inventory and options, because then we can just really plan it out and be thoughtful, but you'll see activity across our Permian next year in a very thoughtful way."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Neal Dingmann Got it.  all so much for the time.
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Scialla Yeah. , buddy. See what the next steps would be at [Indiscernible] the issue with both appraisals. They're just lack of reservoir quality sands as you stepped out. Did you just step out too far in the edge so you need to move back towards the discoveries with the next appraisals or is it more complicated than that?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Christmann Mike, it's a . I will tell you that at [Indiscernible] it was a big step out. We know it looked a little different in terms of the signature. So we knew there was more risk to it. But there is work to do at Cadcassie, in closer. But I think from the priorities, it will all be put into is your working across all the discoveries and the appraisal program. We're integrating data. We've prioritized for the appraisal there things that you would be what I'll call lower GOR black oil that you could potentially fast-track. And so we're working those in a queue based on the learnings, we've integrated everything in. Some of that will come to one of the reasons why crab to go is the next exploration well. It's in the neighborhood and we like the way it looks. So I think it's all part of an integrated plan."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Scialla Okay. Helpful. And maybe just to follow-up on Neal 's question. Can you talk about that decision to put the third rig in the Chalk versus the Midland or Alpine High. And Steve mentioned a plan to add a fourth rig next year. Any early preview on where that might land. I guess, any possibility of going beyond four rigs, and then U.S. next year."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bob Brackett  all. Just a question following up on the Austin Chalk and the Alpine High, how do you think longer-term about the balance of gas-directed drilling versus oil-directed drilling, any thoughts there?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Pursell Bob, I think the beauty of the diverse portfolio is we have the ability to flex that. And so I'm going to give you a non-answer because it really depends on where commodity markets go. Obviously, we've got a very constructive crude market and our gas markets is becoming more constructive. We'd like to see the back end of the gas curve strengthen a little bit from here. But again with the diverse portfolio, both diverse in the Permian and diverse globally, we have the ability to flex and move, and take advantage of commodity markets across the globe. So I'll leave it at that, but we're getting -- we're watching the forward curve on gas let's just leave it at that."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bob Brackett Okay perfectly clear. We're traveling the globe, can you talk about inflation and sort of what's you're baking in domestically, where you might be seeing something a bit higher versus maybe some of the international assets. What's baked into that sort of capex guide in terms of inflation?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Christmann Yes, Bob, you look today and this is the commodities, right? I mean steel is up, where we've got fuel. Your power costs, you are people costs. But it's really steel and people, is how we  frame it. And we have factored some of that into that capital number, as we look at our programs. And then we try to get ahead on the purchases. And so, if you get into the middle of '22, it is baked into our capital numbers."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Bob Brackett Any difference domestically versus internationally? And is there a number you'd hazard to throw out?
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Christmann The other thing I would add, Bob, is some of the targeted divestments have man on our higher water cuts. From Basin Platform properties where we're burning more energy and moving more fluid and those types of things are helping our numbers too in terms of what we're targeting. So there's -- we're trying to be really smart about the portfolio and factoring all those in."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Leo Mariani Hi guys. Just wanted to follow up on the stock buyback program here. I guess, high level you guys talked about roughly I guess $2 billion of free cash flow. There's some dividend here, but 60% to the buyback I mean, that certainly could imply North of a billion dollars on the buyback. And just in our math, that's certainly seems to be a very large percentage of your shares outstanding currently approaching 15%, upwards of that maybe in one year or next year. Just wanted to get a sense of do you guys think that a number that size is roughly correct and is it feasible to buyback that much stock?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney Well, if the share price stays roughly where it is, and that'll be the outcome, yes. And if oil prices stay where they are."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney And, yes, I think it is feasible. Yes."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Leo Mariani Okay. And then just wanted to follow-up on the Austin Chalk here. So obviously, it's like this point you've dedicated rig. In your slide deck you talked about one well result looked very strong. Presumably there's probably more than that in terms of results that maybe you guys have seen out there. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more color in terms of inventory of aerial extent of where you guys have drilled. Is there an acreage number you think is a sweet spot out there for you that, would give you just a number of years of inventory and maybe just more color about what that rig is doing. Is it all development work? Is there going to be a mix of some exploration in there? Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color about what the run rig is doing and what you've seen so far?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Pursell Yeah. It's . The way -- on the Brazos County side, we haven't really talked yet about the sides of this, but there is some -- I wouldn't call it exploration, but there is some additional delineation work we're doing to see how big this could be. But when we look at it, there's easily over five rig years worth of development to do in this one spot. So again, we're leveraging a lot of our knowledge on the work we've done over in the Washington County area as operator and as John suggested, a fairly significant non-op position. We'll leave it at that."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Freeman I wanted to follow up on Alpine High, which I'm sure you would have -- a couple of quarters ago, I don't think we would have realized that we haven't multiple questions on Alpine High, but obviously a lot of things change. And  so I guess, when I look at the Alpine High and what gas NGL prices have done. And then following up on the recent Altice - EagleClaw deal where those processing gathering rigs got a heck of a lot more attractive. And then I know that you have done some stuff on wider spacing than you are used to do there as well. I'm just curious as it sounds pretty likely that that fourth rate will go to Alpine High if we might -- there might be some plan to get an update on the economic model for Alpine High cause it has been quite a while since we've seen it."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Pursell Yes, John, this is Dave. We look for that as we get into 2022 and really kind of hone in on where that additional rigs are going to focus. But you're right. I mean, it's not just gas price and cost structure. We've done some things on performance, on some of the docks with spacing as well as its prac design and some of those wells are in the public domain and the results are very, very good and certainly exceeded our expectations. So there's a number of factors that would drive us to really focus on Alpine as well as some of the other opportunities out there."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Freeman Okay. And then just the follow-up question on Egypt. So if I heard you right, John, it sounded like the 11 rigs was going to go higher post the modernization, getting completed if I heard that right. And obviously it's been a while since we've been at this sort of an activity set. So Egypt until at least Suriname gets to a point where it's at first oil, Egypt becomes the growth driver for the Company. And I guess I'm just curious when we think historically has been an 8 rig program or so would try and keep production roughly flat if we go 11 rigs plus. Is it a double-digit type growing asset just I guess any additional color how you're thinking about Egypt."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Christmann Clearly, we've been gradually ramping, right? We went from 5 -- we started the year around 5 rigs, we went to 8, now we are at 11. The plan would be to go up another step. I don't see us going back -- needing to go back to where we once were in the mid-20 rang e. But it will -- it's going to turn the corner. We've been under -- slightly under-investing in Egypt for quite a number of years. And definitely we'll turn the trajectory the other way, which is what Egypt wants. And quite frankly, part of the overall win-win that 's in this for Egypt and APA."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Scialla Actually, John just asked my 2 questions, but I'll ask one more. The asset retirement liability being put back to you with those Gulf of Mexico assets, does Fieldwood continue to operate there and do you have any input on what they do there?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney No. Those assets came out of Fieldwood, so the Legacy Fieldwood Company is now a Company called Quarter North. And they don't own the old Fieldwood assets that Apache had sold to them. Those came out and went into an interview that we now call Tom Shelf. There is a person that's contract managing those assets because there are assets that are still producing. But the contract today is in place with Quarter North, the old field with organization to operate those assets for us, and we will continue to evaluate whether that's the best long-term situation."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Scialla Is there any thought on just taken over or could you potentially take over operations there? Or do you want -- if you've got the -- all the liability, would it make sense to operate it yourself?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney situation. The present value of all of those costs today are about 250 million. Guess we had to book an undiscounted number of the 450 million. The other thing I just might comment on is that the way we went about doing the work, because we only got access to the raw data behind all of this in August and we've been scouring through that since we got that. We've looked hard at abandonment costs and we've looked at -- the 2nd priority was to look at the operating assets and the cash flow from the PDPs on those. And then the 3rd priority was to look at the capital investment opportunities, because any assets like these are going to have uphold recompletion opportunities and things like that. That was the third priority and we really haven't gotten through all of those. There are literally hundreds of capital investment opportunities. We got to the ones that, we think -- we thought were the highest priorities se emed like the best opportunities. And so those are included in the free cash flows. But we think there are more. We think that, there are opportunities to reduce the operating and overhead costs in the PDPs and we believe there are probably more opportunities in investment side that, we just haven't been able to get to yet. So we'll be -- we should be watching for those over the coming quarters. And that has a decent chance of possibly bringing that $450 million liability down over time. And that would also decrease obviously, the present value of that opportunity."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Scialla  for the detail on that, Steve. One more. You'd mentioned Steve, that the divestitures you plan next year. I know you guys don't want to give detail on that, but I'm just curious. Can you speak broadly as to what assets might be put in that divestiture bucket or I'm assuming they are on the domestic side and outside of your 3 core areas or were core interception?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Christmann Mike actually, we sold some Central Basin Platform properties earlier this year that were higher costs, higher water cut, later life in the country for having a portfolio for a long long time. What I call some of the legacy. You can anticipate more of those types of assets is probably what would make sense."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,John Christmann . You have your last question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate Hey guys. Sorry for double-dipping today, but I have a couple of things I wante d some clarification on so I queued up again. First one is -- on the buyback I think I missed the comment and I'll ask a question like this. When you take disposals potentially into account, as well as, I guess we've already dealt with the Egyptian thing as it relates to cash flow. Is it an upward limit on how aggressive you would expect to be with the buybacks? In absolute terms?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney So just to get a bit of color on that, Doug, I think again, I think our shares are trading at a pretty meaningful discount today. They have improved over the last month or so and that no doubt as part of the purpose of the buyback. But we believe there's still trading at a meaningful discount relative to the price environment we find ourselves in. And we just think that's, for long-term shareholders, that's one of the better investment opportunities we can make, so we'll continue doing that. As long as the free Cash Flow holds up. So that's why we say it's a minimum of 60%."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate Steve, the 5-1/4 million, does that go to the Balance Sheet or does that go to buybacks as well, because that's not technically Operating cash flow?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney Yes we're just going to remain noncommittal on what the buybacks, and for that matter, the other 40% can go to the -- I mean the disposal proceeds and the other 40% of free Cash flow because we'll deal with that as it occurs. Could go to Balance Sheet strengthening, could go to more buybacks, could raise the dividend quicker. We've got -- we've got a number of things on the horizon with Egypt modernization also occurring. So we've got a lot of things still ahead of us here."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate I don't want to labor the point but credit agencies, do they have a view on the buyback, have you run this past them to get their opinion?"
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney We haven't spoken to them yet, but we will be speaking with them shortly."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney We will reassure them of the same thing that we've talked about here today. We're still going to have plenty of free cash flow to do further balance sheet improvements and [Indiscernible] from asset disposals, if we need to do that and if we feel like that's the best thing to do at the point in time."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate . My follow-up is a real quick one for clarification. Cheniere is your contract kicking in pari - passu with their 3rd Corpus Christi development, which is not even FID-ed yet. My understanding was that that contract to become effective middle of next year. Can you just offer some clarification on the timing? And maybe what you would expect that the ultimate tooling costs to be for you guys."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Riney Yes, I can certainly comment on the first part of that. Our contract is, while it was in the context of FID in another project, it's not contractually tied to any project. And so it's just a contract that, starts in 2023 and runs for 15 years. A 140 million cubic feet a day, and Schneer has an option to bring that forward one year to start it in mid 2022, July of 2022. And we were waiting to see if they will exercise that option."
4465554,APA Corporation,APA,11/4/2021,CEO John Christmann on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Christmann  Doug. That ends our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to John Christmann for closing remarks. . And before ending today's call, I'd like to leave you with the three following points. First, we're taking prudent and appropriate steps now to increase our capital investment to a level that will enable us to sustain production on a global basis for many years. Our portfolio offers considerable depth and flexibility to do this efficiently. Second, we're generating substantial free cash flow in this environment, which we currently estimate will be around $2 billion for the full-year 2021 and again in 2022. And lastly, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow via dividends and share buybacks. And we're demonstrating our commitment to this process right now in the Fourth Quarter.  for participating in our call today. Operator, I'll turn it over to you. That concludes the conference call.  all for participating. You may now disconnect."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Krueger I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on your group non-medical health claim trends in the quarter. I guess, in particular, and I know disability is a bit smaller for you, but some companies have had weaker disability results and it sounds like yours held up pretty well. So I appreciate any detail you could provide here."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ramy Tadros  Ryan. It's Ramy here. So on the disability front, as you noted, it's - relative to our premium, it's about 12% of our overall PFOs in group. And I can give you some color based on both the LTD and the STD portions of the book. So for the LTD side, what we saw is an incidence rate this quarter that's much more in line with our historical norms. It was higher than last year but last year was a favorable incidence here from a disability perspective. So we're seeing it tick back to where it was historically from a frequency perspective. And then, the recoveries continue to be pretty strong. The other thing I would add there on the LTD side is so far, we have not seen any significant impact on the business from kind of COVID or non-COVID effect, neither have we seen any material impacts from the overall economy. So it's been pretty much a return to, call it, a pre-pandemic levels as far as the LTD book. For the STD side, it's a bit different. So think about that 12% of disability premium, two-thirds of it is sitting in the LTD only a third of it sits in the STD. And then for that one-third that's in STD, about half of those employees are comprised of ASO only business. So we are administering the disability claims but not on the hook for the actual claims themselves. So while for the STD portion, we have seen and continue to see elevated STD COVID claims. The actual impact on the non-medical health ratio is pretty de minimis given the composition of our book and the ASO exposure."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Ryan Krueger . That was helpful. . And then you've had some benefit from RMBS paydowns in RIS. How should we think about the ongoing impact of that? Or what's left of it from here?
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Erik Bass So we've seen more in-force block transactions over the past quarter with sellers getting pretty attractive multiples. And it seems like there's plenty of buyer interest in the types of liabilities you have, and now there are some potential counterparties that have New York entities. So I'm curious if you're getting more optimistic about finding a transaction that could potentially unlock value in portions of your MetLife Holdings blocks?"
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John McCallion Eric, it's John. I'd say the short answer is, yes. If the question is, are we getting more optimistic? Yes. We are seeing what you're referencing as well. I think the supplier and buyer base is continuing to remain, I'd say, robust. And I think our team continues to work and take a third-party view and do the analytics around our portfolio. And as we've - I've talked about before, quite a bit of it is thinking about what are of interest of different buyers. It differs. Not everyone is thinking the same way or have they - buyers have different tools for creating value. And so we have to think through that and think about our situation as well and how we would optimize from our end. And I think there is a puzzle to put together there to think through how to best optimize a situation like that. As we've talked about before, we're not going to do something at any cost. But we are continuing to look at things to optimize and accelerate the release of reserves and capital appropriately. And I think that's - we're still on track with that."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Erik Bass , . And then second, I was hoping you could give some perspective on what's going on in Chile and the potential implications for your business. I guess specifically, what are the different proposals that are out there for the AFP system from the leading presidential candidates. And do you see risk of significant change to that business following the election? And also hoping you could talk about the early annuity payouts issues that's been covered in the press and whether that's material for you at all."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jimmy Bhullar Just had a question on the group business. If you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of claims utilization, both frequency and severity in your dental book?"
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ramy Tadros Sure, Jimmy. It's Ramy here. I would say the dental story is very much a return to pre-pandemic utilization. So if you look at the quarter-over-quarter results, 2020 was exceptionally low in terms of dental utilization. We've seen that come back to normal levels. Q3 tends to be seasonally lower. So Q4 tends to kind of slightly tick up typically in terms of the dental business. So very much kind of a return to normal. And I would say if you look at the overall ratio, our non-medical health ratio. And our expectation right now is that for the full year, we're going to get a ratio that's very close to the midpoint of our range."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jimmy Bhullar Okay. And then on the accounting changes, can you talk about where you are internally on sort of the process of figuring out what the impact will be on MetLife? And then relatedly, when do you think you'll start quantifying the impact and sharing it with the investment community?"
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John McCallion , Jimmy, it's John. We are well underway on our implementation work, progress continues. And I'd say, continue to be on target for implementation come 11/23. We're going to - we're in the process of evaluating transition amounts and ongoing impacts of the new guidance. And I'd say our plan is still intact, which would be kind of a mid-2022 timeframe, give or take, for disclosing and kind of sharing how to think about the transition and the insights you should draw upon this. Again, I'd remind everyone that ultimately economics, cash flow, pricing product does not change. And I think we're working well with the industry to think through how we collectively transition ourselves and kind of explain the results. And I think that's going well. So at this point, I'd say nothing has caused us to feel the need to change the time line."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jimmy Bhullar And have you had conversations with the rating agencies on how they would view, obviously, they focus on cash flows and stat as well but they do look at cap also. But do you think there will be changes because a lot of your GAAP ratios would obviously end up changing once the rules are implemented."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tom Gallagher , John. Just a fo llow-up on Erik's question on risk transfer. Would you say is - are variable annuities the priority or you're looking broader that might include life insurance and fixed annuities. And just a related question, does your New York domicile limit the types of counterparties that you might transact with? Or would you say it's still a pretty robust list as you're thinking about things that would be in a potential auction bidding situation?"
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John McCallion , Tom. I would say the answer to the first question would be would be, we're open to all blocks of business that create value for us. So I think a lot of different aspects go into value creation when it comes to that question. So I don't think it's one focus there or another. I'd say probably the only one that could probably scope out or say is less likely as LTC just given where bid spreads are at these days. But I'd say markets are evolving on all the other ones. And then you have to look at your own kind of situation to think about the benefits we get from having them in our New York domiciled entity. And so that's how we would kind of frame it. I wouldn't exclude anything outside of, let's say, LTC just given where I think pricing is, there's a pretty big divergence in what people think at this point. On the other aspect of counterparty, I would say, we come at it probably the same way that our New York domicile partners would come at it as well. So I don't know if it changes who or how we would do transaction. I think we probably take somewhat of a similar construct because at the end of the day, our situation would be a reinsurance transaction from the New York domiciled entity. And so credit risk would matter. And so structure can help with that as well. But I don't think it excludes anything per se, but that would be a strong consideration."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tom Gallagher Okay. . And then just one quick one. Long-term care claims, you said, returned to more normal levels this quarter. Was that on both claim frequency and severity? And the reason I ask is, there's clearly, from what we've heard from other has been a shift away from facility care to home health care, which has lowered severity. I'm just curious, if you have that level of detail for how that's trending right now?"
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Humphrey Lee , and  for taking my questions. Related to EMEA, you talked about there are some favorable items in the quarter and expect fourth quarter to trend down along with some of the high expenses. Is there any way to help us think about what would be the kind of the run rate earnings for EMEA?"
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John McCallion Yes. , Humphrey. So yes, we had a very strong Q3, I'd say, a number of items went in one direction that caused us to have a very strong result in Q3. As we think about quantification of that, you could put it in the area of, call it, $20 million, $25 million, give or take. And then as I said on - in my prepared remarks, we'd expect some elevated technology investments in the in the fourth quarter. So I'll give you some data point from this sure I give you anything outside of that, but that probably should help you kind of frame for your modeling."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Humphrey Lee And then in terms of the overall expenses for company, is the 12.3% for the full year still the appropriate way to think about the expenses for 2021?"
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,John Barnidge An increase COVID impact on the group Life business is there a need to increase administrative expenses to deal with him during nature the pandemic at all?
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ramy Tadros John, it's Rami here. The expense ratio on the Life business is pretty small. So the real the real issue is not operations or expenses, the real issue and the challenge you're seeing is just the claims front. So it's not really an expense issue at all this point."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Barnidge And then, would it be fair to say, if the seasonal increase in the direct expense ratio overall, obviously about 12.3% seems fair to come in well below 12% for the year, would there be a reevaluation of it longer term possibly? ."
4465557,"MetLife, Inc.",MET,11/4/2021,CEO Michel Khalaf on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John McCallion And then I can take the second question you had John. This is John as well. Yes, our target is under 12.3% you said is it possible. Sure, anything is possible I guess, but ultimately, we are steadfast on being at or below 12.3%. Again, what we're trying to do is shift the mix of expenses that are within our expense base, and continue to drive savings and capacity for reinvestment. So we want to maintain being at or below 12.3% on a persistent basis every year. But at the same time, we want to continue to drive efficiencies that free up the allocation of resources to invest in the customer, invest in our processes, and to continue to drive growth for the firm. And so, at the same time, if we see headwinds in an economy, we can use that capacity as a protection for profit margin. So that's kind of our philosophy when it comes to our efficiency mindset. And I'd say nothing would kind of take us off that track at this point. There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our CEO, Michel Khalaf for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. . , Operator. While the third quarter had outsized PE returns and COVID claims, we believe the underlying performance of our business, demonstrates the enduring strength and growth potential of the MetLife global insurance franchise. Although the pandemic continues to create uncertainty, I am confident in our ability to continue to execute and create long-term shareholder value for shareholders. Have a  day. Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude your conference call for today. ON behalf of today's panel we like to  for your participation in today's earnings call and  for using our service. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Adam Samuelson So Tony, Bert, Chris, I guess what I'm trying to reconcile and think about is the risk of demand destruction at current nitrogen and fertilizer prices broadly. I mean, you talked about record demand for ammonia in the fall, those prices were also booked several $100 ago relative to where the stock market is. And so, as you think about the order patterns into the First Quarter, do you see any risks on farmers and their application rates? And obviously, nitrogen is less discretionary, but do you think that could have any impact on agronomic yield given where affordability is today?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will When you look across the world and where we are starting with just supply, it's just not there. This is more of a supply constrained market. The demand is definitely there. You're seeing we're desperately trying to pull in tons and we'll continue to do so through, I expect into their next fertilizer year, which begins in April. Brazil is ahead 10% year-on-year and probably will continue at that pace through importing urea, at least through February for their safrinha. And then we hit our spring in the Northern hemisphere. With what's going on in Europe with gas prices in the level of shutdown, there's over 11 million tons of ammonia that is currently not being upgraded into ammonium nitrate, urea, or CAN, and so tons need to flow, which were not planned in the supply and demand scenario to Europe. We were in a supply limited market and that's what's going to keep prices elevated. The demand side of the equation is still very strong and you're correct. What we sold for fall and we're applying today was sold at levels much lower than the current market, which is probably over $1,000 for ammonia. That being said, we're selling $1,000 ammonia for fall application on the -- on incremental tons that are available. Where as I said on my prepared remarks we're selling urea and there is significant demand at that $730, $750 short ton NOLA, it's even higher in the interior at over $800, which we've transacted a poor deal. And you've seen in the publications, the UAN reaction and the demand pulling, and I just looked at the analysis of where we are to date with order books and demand. And again, at a very good place of $550 UAN, calculating all that forward with current trend yield at 177 bushels per acre on the trend yield. That's not considering the Ince dates where you will be 275 bushels. Even with rent as land, at today's economics, your cash positive. You're actually profitable at a pretty healthy level if you own your land even more so. There are ways to economize. And so if you have a firm, you can look at different options, but that's not going to come at the expense of nitrogen and probably even at fertilizer. It's going to come at some other issues. We're constructively, as I have said positive. I would say very positive. And the customer advances continue to come in, and so we are working with our retail partners to make sure that that supply is available and our retail partners are buying that. And moving on there's going to be a substantial amount of cash coming into our retail friends"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Chris Bohn demand, there's going to be a lot of unmet demand that's going to be pent-up. And so, we do think yield is going to be on a global basis off next year. Again, not because demand destruction, just because there's not enough tonnes available. And what that means is it's going to promote favorable supply-demand dynamics and core screens as we get out into 2023 and probably beyond. Our view is that this is a very, very healthy dynamic that leads to a much longer period of positive fundamentals for our business."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joel Jackson Just thinking about your order book and Bert I don't want to misquote you, but I think you've talked about before when prices go up, you tend to book more product more floor it can no longer dated order book as prices go up. Prices have really gone up. So would that be the case that really you book more product into Q1 than you normally have at this time, normally have it at the other time?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Martin Jarosick September and then in October $535. And so as I said, we are booked for Q4 and the majority of the $285 UAN was shipped in Q3 a little bit in Q4. And then those other prices will blend in. As we look forward to Q1, we're starting to book those values today. And so you're looking at that's $530 to $550 for Q1, and $700 to $750 probably for urea. And we have yet to price Q2 ammonia. And once we book out Q1, then we'll look at Q2, but if there's substantial demand for Q2, we would rather sort Q1 first."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Byrne Yes, . You laid out the significant levels of disruption in supply that are going on. And most recently, you have Russia jumping into that theme, and I wanted to get your view on how significant is that? I understand that essentially, all of the ammonium nitrate that Brazil imports comes from Russia. If that is the case, and -- where are they going to get it now? And are there regions of the world that you think are just flat out not going to be able to get nitrogen for the Spring?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bert Frost Yes. So when you look at the Russia announcement, I would say in -- contextually, the Chinese announcement is much more significant. Because of what has come out traditionally from China, the 4 to 5 million tons of urea exports and also phosphates that is going to have a -- because that's the incremental ton that is continually bid in. So in a world of 50 million tonnes of world traded urea to take out up to 10% is going to be felt on top of the demand as I mentioned earlier from Europe, that needs to move. So you're going to see North African tonnes moving into Europe and there's going to be a hole. Like Tony said, somebody is going to have to struggle or pay up. The Russia announcement was a little bit of a surprise. The Russian demand for nitrogen fertilizers has been fairly consistent in that 5.5 million to 6.5 million tons of demand per year, and they've exported the remainder. And so when you look at from year-on-year what Russia has consumed and what Russia has exported, on the margin, there's probably going to be a shortage of up to 0.5 million tons. So Brazil will be able to get their ammonium nitrate. And I believe the suppliers from Russia; EuroChem, Macron, and the others, will do that, as well as supply some of the portion that's needed in Europe. So It's going to come again on the margin and every month there'll be less tons available from an expected source, which further exacerbates this supply-demand imbalance that we've been discussing."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Byrne Maybe a question for Chris, the decision to focus on Yazoo City as another carbon capture project in addition to Donaldsonville, do you have any more clarity about where the demand was going to be coming from for the blue ammonia. Are you increasingly confident that you can move those tons and generate a sufficient premium to offset your capital investment and generate a return?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Chris Bohn And I think when these projects do come online, because it will take 2 to 3 years, you'll also see domestic d emand for blue specifically at the levels that we've been producing at Yazoo."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Zekauskas  very much. When do you expect to produce 1.25 million tons of blue ammonia? And how do you think about the price of blue ammonia? Is it relative to the price of agricultural ammonia or is it independent or it's relative to fuel prices? And so with all -- with those issues, how do you think  about the returns on selling blue ammonia?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will Relative to the value of blue ammonia, at a minimum, I would say the value is equivalent to a regular conventional ton plus whatever carbon jurisdiction you're talking about. In Europe, you're talking about EUR50 or above a ton. In the U.K. it's more like PS50. Other regions are going to have different cost structures from a regulatory environment. And so at a minimum, I would say you're able to get whatever prevailing value of carbon is on top of a regular traded ton and, as Chris highlighted, if you think about the total variable cost required to produce a ton of blue ammonia, we probably have somewhere in the neighborhood $5 to $10 a ton of electricity cost on plant site. And then we're in pretty advanced discussions with a number of potential parties on the transport and injection. And believe that that is a very manageable number from an overall cost standpoint and so the all-in the variable costs that we incur is less than the value of the 45Q credit. And so the differential will go towards paying back the capital even before you put any premium on blue ammonia. So just on the value of the 45Q, we feel comfortable that we'll get returns above our cost of capital. And then to the extent you're able to realize margins and additional premium on blue. That just further adds to the attractiveness of this investment for us."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Zekauskas Okay, and for my follow-up, some farmers say that they really can't secure nitrogen product for the second quarter. And in your commentary, you said you're really trying to put together your first quarter order book. Is that a generally correct description that farmers can't really get commitments into the second quarter just yet?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will which is the first time since I've been here in 13 years that all of our railcars are occupied. Product is moving to market, product is available. Now that being said, CF is not pricing Q2 as of yet. And that's a pricing position. That's not a volume nor a commitment situation. I believe if retailers wanted to take that out or a farmer wanted to get a quote or an offer that should be available in the market. And there will be sufficient tons to meet spring demand, is not only from CF, but from the broader industry group. Imports are up, domestic production will recover, and yes, we will have a spring. Jeff, I realize I didn't -- sorry -- I didn't see your first part of the question about blue ammonia in terms of when is it going to be available."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will We've gone ahead and launched those projects now, we anticipate probably end of 2024 or early 2025. So by 2025, we expect basically a full year of operating on that basis."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vincent Andrews  and , everyone. Tony, what -- would love to get your thoughts on just sort of as we think about the next few years or 3 to 5 years or you want to frame it. When you carry a situation now with obviously very tight grain stocks and now we've had this spike in gas and coal prices and so forth and having a lot of food inflation and Bert laid out a very plausible scenario where we could have lower yields because of the inability of everybody get nitrogen and so forth. So what do you think the global response to this is going to be over time in terms of trying to manage the food supply and make sure that we don't get into extreme situations like this into perpetuity, but at the same time we need to balance our climate goals and our green energy aspirations and so forth. So how does this [Indiscernible] get thread in your view?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will It's a . And I think as you point out, there are a lot of competing priorities out there that have second order and tertiary knock-on effects that not everyone understands well. So the push to reduce availability and affordability of fossil fuels because of a focus on climate change and move towards renewable, I think is directly part of what's going on in Europe right now with extremely high natural gas costs. And that means that all of those plants that Bert talked about earlier curtailed are offline. At the same time, you've got a number of governments around the world that are very focused on trying to limit the rate of nitrogen  fertilizer in particular because of their concerned about nutrient loss to the environment and runoff and whether it's nitrous oxide produced on the field, but it's pretty potent greenhouse gas, or whether it's other run-off into waterways and so forth. There is a real push in some areas, Canada notably and in other places as well to reduce application rate. And if you do that, you're going to have a year with impact on yields. There are a number of, I would say, competing priorities out there. All of which generally speaking, I would say benefit North America producers. Because we do have ready access to low-cost gas. We're on the very low end of the supply curve. And as yields continue to struggle due to either lack of availability of nutrients or these programs designed to reduce nutrient application, that's just going to keep grain prices higher for longer. Ultimately, I think where this goes as governments are going to have to capitulate to  the requirements of their people and provide affordable food which means some of those priority is, that they have here before held out as being these holy grails. They are going to probably have to take a backseat for a while, just to make sure that we can feed the people the world. But I think that you will see people backing off. Again, Germany has decommissioned their nukes and they've brought on coal-fired power plants. That's not exactly what I would call a green initiative. You've seen the same thing in China as well in the UK, and Continental Europe are struggling with high gas costs. I do think there is going to have to be a reassessment of what is required to -- for the planet to be able to eat and fuel itself."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Roberts . And back on the earlier question on the blue ammonia, do you do you expect to sell it as fuel or do you expect to sell it as fertilizer, and have some carbon credit broker gets you the revenue for the sequestration values?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will Yes, John. As Chris mentioned, and we've highlighted earlier, we do have this in place with Mitsui, we're having very productive conversations with them. I think there is a real emphasis, particularly in Japan, but in some other regions as well to go into, coal combustion of ammonia with coal to reduce the CO2 emissions out of those plants. And we think that that is something that I will develop into a pretty sizable market. Estimates can be as much as 5 million tonnes by the time you get to 2030, or possibly even before. And that's a huge increase in terms of the total amount of ammonia being consumed, particularly what you've got curtailments and outages and -- across broad swaths of the production universe here in Europe and the U.K. And so we're excited about the Clean Energy attributes that blue ammonia has. We think that that's probably where the majority of value sits, at least in the near term. Well, I think there is certainly the possibility to get some incremental value off of carbon sequestration in the soil from an agricultural application given that most of that is going into the voluntary marketplace today where values are traded at a pretty small discount to where structured carbon trades and the rest of the world. I think that's probably the last place just because of lower values that we would go now that the U.S. develops a more structured approach to the cost of carbon and you can get a scientific valuation placed on carbon capture to sequestration and the soil than that may change the math. But I think in the near term what we're really looking at is more of a clean energy source and we're working very closely with Mitsui to help develop that and bring that about. The other point though that I would say is we believe these projects are attractive just based on the 45Q credit that we ought to be able to generate a return on these projects without any embedded premium on Blue. Now, our expectation is there's going to be a sizable premium on Blue. But to be clear, we're able to make the math work pretty easily just with the 45Q credit."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Roberts And then how are you thinking about the pace of buyback under the new authorization? Is it going to be opportunistic, or are you thinking something that's just going to be more structured over the 2 years?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will Yes. I think based on what we're looking at in terms of not only current year performance but our expectations for next year, there's going to be a lot of cash that needs to find a home. And so while -- we'll certainly buy more on dips or at lower prices, I think it needs to be the volume that we're talking about is sizable enough that it probably needs to be a bit of a structured leg in there as well. So ultimately, probably a combination of approaches."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Parkinson , . Just over the last 5 years, there's been a plethora of variables that's still driving a bit of volatility in the end unit UAN pricing versus urea. Just given the current supply and demand dynamics, trade flow adjustments over the last few years, and the recent DOC case, can you just comment on your outlook for UAN pricing for '22, '23 as it pertains to UAN versus urea.  so much."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will And so in that context, we see UAN trading at advantaged position to urea, as well blue ammonia and ammonium nitrate. And that market, we don't see demand destruction, we see differences of supply availability."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Parkinson That's  color. And just as a quick follow-up, just given on -- given what's going on in China, what's your intermediate to long-term view of export trends and what the ultimate price will be for those tons on an MMBtu basis? ."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will But -- and I would also add, Chris, just based on what the forward curves look like, it's moved really Europe, and in particular Eastern Europe, into what I would call the marginal production ton in the world as opposed to out of China. But the factors that Bert was talking about means that China's not going to overwhelm the global marketplace with excess exports. And so that's going to maintain what we believe is going to be a relatively tight supply side equation. And just based on energy spread differentials that you can look forward, it's a much steeper supply curve than it's been recently, and that gives us a lot of opportunity here to generate cash in the U.S. So we're very constructive about all of these trends."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"P.J. Juvekar There's all these resource nationalism going on about nitrogen that you talked about, but yours is still a net importer of urea. So how did this play out? Would growers switch from corn to soybeans at the margin, or maybe the industrial demand has to back down to make room for agricultural demand. In your mind, how does this play out in the medium-term?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bert Frost On the corn to soybean competition, today, it's favoring corn and it has been. And this is the time when it makes sense -- that when it's very good for us to have that favorability because that's when today or in this period is when farmers are making that spring planting decision and allocating their resources accordingly and therefore booking fertilizer, which is positive for us. We're seeing very strong industrial demand in our book and we balanced both of those. We think well as well as our industry, so I think it's a net positive."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"P.J. Juvekar . That's good color. And just one quick one. Tony, when you talked about, and  for giving the details on blue versus green ammonia. It seems like blue ammonia will be more costly to make by $20 or $30 or something like that per ton. And so why would growers buy more expensive ammonia unless they're incented to buy? What's the mechanism for them to spend more?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will And that's also honestly why Donaldsonville and Yazoo City are not the last dehydration compression projects that we're likely to build. We want to continue to evaluate other places with ready access to sequestration and continue to build out our network, because our belief is it's a project that pays for itself and also gives upside opportunity on access in the clean-energy market in a way that is differential for us versus other market participants."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Piken Hi. . Just wanted to discuss in a little bit more detail on the status of your U.K. operations. I know they were down for a couple of days, and then you guys were -- reached an agreement with the government to restart it. When you talked about getting back to the 19.5 million to 20 million tons, the implication I assume there is that those plants are going to run full next year. Maybe you could just talk about the status of those plants? And are they going to be profitable, or -- what type of returns we're looking at there, given the higher gas costs?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will Michael, . So the first thing that I want to just highlight is the relative importance of the U.K. in terms of the overall portfolio. As Chris mentioned, if you look back to our results in 2020, it represented 2% of our total gross margin. So from an aggregate profitability standpoint, it's on the small end of the scale. Now, it does provide a little bit of a natural hedge for us when global energy costs are low and relatively flat, then we earn a better return there when energy costs are hig h, we earn a much better return in the U.S. on a larger production base. It's a little bit of a natural hedge in that regard. But as you mentioned, because of a huge spike in gas cost in September, we took the plants offline. We worked, I would say very constructively with the U.K. government to restart the facility at Billingham and be able to provide CO2 into the U.K. marketplace, that's pretty critical for the normal functioning of a number of different industries over there. And during that period of time, the U.K. government also is very helpful and us -- working with us and the CO2 off take. Company is the industrial gas Company from Billingham to restructure those contracts in a way that makes that plant viable. So we're really pleased with how that whole process developed. And the Billingham plant is up and operational and we expect that to be viable in the long-term. The Ince plant in the Northwest is not yet back online. We're evaluat ing a number of different options and scenarios there, including being able to secure a vessel to bring ammonia into the facility so we can at a minimum run the upgrade plants. Given again the high cost of natural gas through the winter, it doesn't look like ammonia production there is going to make a lot of sense, but being able to bring in ammonia will allow us to run the upgrades and make an appropriate return on those products. So we're in a little bit of a wait and see mode in terms of what the longer range situation develops in the U.K. But I think for now, Billingham is up and operation al. We expect that to happen. And again, we expect to be able to turn the back end of the fertilizer portion of the plant up and running. And hopefully soon within the next couple of weeks, once we get the ammonia vessel squared away."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Piken . And then just understanding a little bit longer-term, by the time some of these blue ammonia projects are up and running, is this going to increase your number of product tons? Is this going to come out of some of your other products? How should we be thinking about the cadence of your product tons sold over the next, call it 3-5 years? ."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will Yes. We already run our ammonia plants at full operating rate within -- with the one exception of the U.K. which we just talked about. And so it's not necessarily a situation where there's new tons unless we engage in some debottlenecks, or new capacity or other things like that. And so this is definitely a, pulling tons away from the least profitable portion of our segment of our business, and reallocating them to a higher-margin application. And so it's a margin upgrade as opposed to new production at this time."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andrew Wong  for taking my question. Just going back on blue, green ammonia here, can you talk about how the blue, green ammonia market could impact the dynamics around the gray ammonia market in the future? And we have projects like [Indiscernible] and Yazoo turning some of the volumes from gray to blue. And as those tons are sold in between ammonia applications, like maybe with Mitsui, does that effectively mean a loss of supply for the gray ammonia market? And then on the demand side, like the molecules are the same, could there be a scenario where demand and supply maybe aren't matched up properly. So you have some application that maybe need blue green ammonia, but if there isn't enough, you use a little bit of gray. Just some general, does the emergence of a blue green ammonia market mean potentially a tighter gray market in the future? ."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will I certainly think that's where we see things headed. I also think that's where not wanting to interpret things for them, but I think that that's consistent also with where your products and others see things headed. Hence the announcement both of the Neom project in Saudi Arabia, but also the recent announcement they had in Louisiana around a blue project. And I think a number of the market participants see this coming. I think ultimately what that's going to mean is, you've got more demand than what current supply is in ammonia. It's going to be at the end new production, new capacity, which the world is going to need. And that -- that's pretty attractive relative to valuing existing assets. So we think, overall, this is a terrific set of factors that create a revaluation or rethinking about what the value of our asset base is being that we're the largest ammonia producer in the world."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will And I think the situation is not unlike what we've got today, which is, today, as Bert mentioned, it's more of a supply side constraint given a bunch of curtailments and shutdowns and other disruptions. But in the future, even if those plants are often running and you see demand continue to exceed where supply is capable of reaching, you see price escalation like we're experiencing right now."
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Adrien Tamagno Hello. . Yes. As a follow-up from the previous question, from a CF industries perspective, in the combination of the world being shore of ammonia, as you described. And with current technical deficiency to make significant volumes in a low carbon way, would that make you thinking about going for Greenfield ammonia at some point in time or it's out of question for you?"
4465559,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.",CF,11/4/2021,CEO Tony Will on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tony Will Well, we constantly are evaluating ways to add capacity that are appropriate. I think that our biggest focus area an d the thing that we use as a lens to make all of those decisions is ultimately cash flow per share. And if we can find an opportunity that allows us to expand capacity, whether that's a debottleneck inorganic acquisition or an organic kind of growth, where we believe that that's going to grow our free cash per share, then we'll take a serious run out it. I think these context we'd be much more likely to think about partnerships, structures, or other things like that if we were going to move forward on any of those things. But I do think it's a positive sign when others out there are making announcements about adding capacity. I do believe we're the best operators of ammonia plants in the world. And so if there's opportunities for new capacity additions, we ought to be thinking about that along with other people and I do think the world is going to need it. It's a question of when and in the interim, are you better off buying existing assets or  debottlenecking what you already have versus building new, but I think those are appropriate questions that anyone in the industry today is moiling over and really thinking about."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Rich Dealy Neil, appreciate the question. I think as Scott mentioned, the reinvestment rate is in that 30 to 40% of cash flow projections for 2022. When you think about inflation, it's similar to what I've talked about before. We have seen some upward pressure mainly on materials when you think about Tubulars, Diesel, Cement, Sand, chemicals. And we're starting to see some in labor, as it's gotten a little tighter on the labor side. We've been able to offset that with some efficiency improvements and our long-term contracts helped dampen that impact but, overall for the year we're expecting to see mid-single-digit inflation for the year with probably as we move toward the end of the year closer to 10% inflation, which will push us up in our capital guidance range toward the -- probably the higher end of that capital range. As you look at 2022, we're looking at probably something in the mid-single-digits from an inflationary standpoint. And hopefully we'll still be able to offset and we still plan to offset some of that with efficiency gains. But having said all that, I think with the higher commodity prices we'll still be able to offset the inflation and really will still allow for stronger overall margins, which is driving up, or allowing us our reinvestment rate to come down from the 50% to 60%, to 30% to 40% for 2022."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah I appreciate the color and then just spend some time talking about the asset sales. Why did you think monetizing the Delaware made sense? It sounds like it's -- a big part of it is just a core up here into Midland, and how do you think about use of proceeds? It doesn't sound like a buyback is eminent as you want to be procyclical with that, is this just really to bolster the dividend payout?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Scott Sheffield Yeah, Neal. First of all, we knew that when we acquired the Delaware and ranked it versus the Midland Basin, that it doesn't compete under various price scenarios long term. And so we wanted to take roughly a period of several quarters and evaluate it. And as I had mentioned last call, that we had, we had been approached by a Company, and so we started the process -- complete that process and decided to go in vest. Let's go into the Balance Sheet. I think going forward, we stated our new debt targets that used to run debt - to-EBITDA 0.75, we lowered it to 0.5 and I'd prefer to have 0 debt long-term. It gives us a lot of options. I've stated already on the buybacks, we'll like to reduce shares significantly, but I'd like to do it at a good price. We think definitely we will be buying back creep. And we've had several dislocations during 2021. It wouldn't surprise me if we have some dislocations during 2022. So you'll see us be buying shares in the marketplace during 2022."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah Awesome. . I don't know what happened, I do apologize and appreciate calling on me. So Scott, you've got probably the best inventory of any E&P in the industry in terms of longevity, visibility, and so on. You've also got the lowest sustainable break even. My issue or my question is that, I don't know that variable dividends get the recognition that an ordinary dividend does. Think about the dividend discount models of a major oil Company. You've got the longevity to get out recognition, why not raise the base dividend?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Scott Sheffield We've already made -- this is only our second variable dividend payment, Doug, Devon mass made will be their third when they make it. And so that the variable dividend just now getting started, I'm a firm believer when you -- when a lot of companies get used and see 11% yield coming out of mid-2022 that we'll get more credit. So I'm being patient in that regard, plus I don't want to get into a habit. You can increase the base, we are going to increase the base, we increased it over 10%, we'll continue to increase the base. But I don't want to get into [Indiscernible] what Neil talked about, I mean, over half our peers had to cut their base, over half the majors cut their base last year. So you don't want to get into a situation where you increase your base to a point to where you have to cut it. It impacts the stock price long-term significantly so, we have to be very careful. I think having a  balance sheet and 0 debt, we have lots of choices b etween buybacks, variable dividends, and base dividends. And so our goal is to return most of that to the shareholders in those three forms."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah I understand the answer, and I guess we'll keep plugging away on that, but  for the answer, Scott. My follow-up is a little bit of a technical issue, so maybe this one's for Neal. I want to talk about cash taxes and the IDC coverage of sustaining capital as you ran the wells roll-off (ph). Because it seems to me that, as we transition into this business model, you guys have clearly embraced and are leading the market on, the concern now is that break-evens are going to start to move back up as cash tax has become real. So as NOLs runoff, maybe for Neal, but you're still spending at sustaining levels, how should we think about the current tax on a cash basis going forward?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Neal Shah Hey, Doug. . If you think about that  break-even, we're really talking about where that operating cash flow equals your capital on a go-forward basis. And in that environment, you could think about Net Income being relatively 0, really, you're not seeing much -- you won't see an impact on your break-even. Now the breakeven will migrate ever so slightly higher. But in that environment, Doug, I'd say the way we view break-even and the way we quantify it. Where again, it's not operating cash flow equaling that capital program, I'd say on the margin, it won't be impactful."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah I guess our first question is for you, Scott. I think I heard in your prepared remarks that you mentioned that you may consider growing oil above 5%. I'm not sure if I caught that correctly, but if I did, is this primarily based on your updated macro view on oil supply demand or is it more related to Company-specific factors such as the right efficiencies and your  Balance Sheet?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Scott Sheffield No. I did mention of always -- I did not mention anything about growing above 5%, so I've stated publicly that we're not going to grow above 5%. In regard to the macro, I do think that we're getting in a very tighter market over the next several years. Unused capacity in OPEC Plus is going to be used up in the next two years, there is no extra supply. I'm a firm believer that we're going to be in $80 to $100 scenario over the next several years."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah My apologies. It sounded weird, so we wanted to check in on that. ."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah And then on the buyback, on our numbers, you'll be well below your half a turn debt target after closing the dollar sales so, can you talk about how you think buybacks create the most value for Pioneer shareholders, meaning you say that you will execute opportunistic buybacks during market dislocations, does that really referred to just crude price dislocations or would you consider doing buybacks that are more correlated to keeping leverage, say, at that half a turn? ."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Scott Sheffield Yeah, Neil, I think one of the things our industry has done a poor job of, is they always buy back at the top. If you look at all the companies and all the CEOs and look at their purchases, they always buy back at the top of the cycle. They never buy back the bottom. I don't know of one Company major or independent that bought last year during the pandemic, except Pioneer. We bought some in the second quarter of last year. So that's 0.1 and it's -- I'd rather buy a lot more shares when they're dislocated. And if you look at our price, we had several dislocations during 2021. And so you'll see us go into the market when you see those dislocations, so I expect to be several dislocations and at the end of the day over a 5-year time period, we hope to reduce the share count by at least 10%. We should be able to if we see the type of prices that are out there in the strip or in the -- just a flat price case. So that's what I hope happens and it's what should happen so."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah . Congratulations on the quarter, and my question is going to be a little bit on the buyback again as well. But can you just discuss the interplay between buybacks and fixed and variable dividends? When you look at the max cap of 75%, you're looking at the variable. Would buybacks be in addition to that, or would you kind of keep that level fairly firm with the all-inclusive between buybac ks and variables?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Scott Sheffield Now, we've stated that we would seriously look at buybacks when our debt - to-EBITDA gets below 0.5. So, it gets below 0.5 by the end of this year it gets to almost 0 In the next year. So as we generate free cash that goes on the Balance Sheet, so we'll have significant firepower for buybacks. So our current buyback that we bought in '19 and '20 is still outstanding, it's still in play. And so obviously, we'll use that, after that we would use them and the Board will look at whether or not to go ahead and announce another buyback. And so there's nothing magic about it. It's just that I think it's long -term, it's important to reduce shares over time."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah Right. So yes. So I guess the [Indiscernible] of my question is in theory, you guys could -- obviously when you look at a total cash return to shareholders fixed variable and buyback, if I were  to look at it that way, certainly it could be in excess of that 75 capital that you utilize for the variable dividends structure, right?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Scott Sheffield Yes. Yeah. It's in excess of the 80% we're returning already. So we're generating so much free cash flow that there's no use. Once you go to 0 debt, you got huge firepower in addition to distributing 80% in regard to dividends. You got firepower to reduce shares also."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Rich Dealy Yes, Scott, Rich here. Yeah, a couple of things. Really no plans to do any incremental hedging at this point in time as Scott talked about, we're bullish on oil prices and think there's more room to move up and then down. And just given our size and scale after doubling the size of the Company with the acquisitions, strong balance sheet, low investment rate. And then you combine that with the current tight supply demand situation, and then just the back gradation of the strip. If you look at the strip, the front month, WTI is kind of $ 83 and you go out 5 years and it's $59, so you almost a 20 $5 drop on WTI so, really no plans today. And from talking to shareholders, they agree with that, really no reason to hedge in this environment and you really just can't hedge out any long term. So the best hedge we have is a strong balance sheet and as Scott talked about, we're going to be on point for the end of this year and virtually 0 in the next year. So that's really from a hedging standpoint, no incremental hedges plans."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah The first question I had last quarter, Rich, you talked about just as the integration went really well, those continued completion and joining efficiency gains and again, that was touched on again on Slide 12 in your presentation, you talked about how last quarter that led to the higher pop cadence and I saw that you have updated the full-year pop guidance from the previous 470 to 510 range to call it 9% hiring now the 535 pumps, and I guess I'm curious if that has sort of any implications for how you sort of think about the longer-term plan -- talked about in the past of needing to add 1 to 2 rigs and sort of support that longer-term growth profile, it's -- these efficiency gains are letting you do sort of more with less in essence?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Neal Shah Yeah, John. , and I would say that we still view it in those 1 to 2 rigs. That was with the bigger Company when we had Delaware, so that probably tweaks it a little bit. But generally, I think it's still in that same range. I don't think it's moved. I mean, obviously we'd love to see that move down as we continue to capture some of these efficiency gains and get better at what we're doing. So overall, I think it's going to be very similar to what we've talked about in the past on the pop side of things for 2021, what I'd say, there's a lot of noise this year with the 2 acquisitions and a lot of it is just timing of whether those wells were popped under prior to us closing the transaction or after. And so we expected a number of the wells that we ended up popping, the double point would have popped before we got to closing. And so I wouldn't read too much into it other than it's just timing of who's watch were those wells under as why we got to higher pop count. I'm hopefully that helps."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah Got it. That does, . And then you talked about potentially the expansion of doing more the 15,000-foot laterals and obviously you are one of the few companies given the contiguous nature of [Indiscernible] to be able to do that over a large part of your position. I just -- is there any sort of, I guess context or additional color you could give on how the 15,000-foot laterals this year have performed relative to call it -- call the more traditional 10,000-foot lateral? Is just any additional color would be helpful?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Joey Hall John, from execution perspective, we had no issues executing on the drilling and completion side. We did about a dozen this year and we'll be looking to probably double that next year, if not a little bit more. From a well productivity perspe ctive, we haven't -- we expect that the wells will perform similar to like our 12 5's and 13's, which is a very positive impact from an economics perspective. So we still continuing to have these enter our program as time goes on, we see these as being a huge value adder to our program."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah . Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. And Neal perhaps for you. I want to get a sense of -- for the Delaware Basin as well as the Laredo transaction and in Glasscock and that would be $3.5 billion in cash proceeds. Could you talk about any tax implications from those 2 transactions? And perhaps the follow-up t here would be -- any thoughts on how much debt would you plan to retire in 2022, if the strip holds based on how you're thinking about the world today?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Rich Dealy Hey, everyone. Just one follow-up on the tax question is -- I'm also just to -- I know you know, but we'll be able to shelter 100% of that tax gain with our $8 billion of NOL so really just we're still forecasting in 2023 we'll be there or at least that we'd be paying in cash taxes."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah In 2023. That's helpful, Rich. And then maybe my follow-up is for Joey. We've seen a couple of your peers really highlight some of the efficiency gains in the Midland Basin from Simon packet, it sounds like you're at two crews today. And how do you think about the adoption of that on a go-forward basis and what type of efficiency gains are you seeing relative to a standard zipper frac crew."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah , and  to all, and congrats on your quarter and the Delaware divestiture. Building on your -- building on your divestiture success and your prepared comments, could you comment on your desire to move more the longer-dated Midland inventory similar to the Laredo transaction, and speak of the potential size of that opportunity set based on the improvement we've experienced at both really the oil and capital markets?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Scott Sheffield Derrick, I don't -- I think as we've talked about on previous calls and then like you've seen demonstrate what the Laredo transaction. We're going to continue to evaluate that every year. And similar to the last three or four years, we've had packa ges that we've done, whether it's outright sales or drill goes. And so the market is there, people are interested in those. And so I think we'll continue to look at those and be strategic about those on an annual basis. So real no change. I mean, we're still going to obviously look to add in terms of acreage trades as well. And so that will be part of our portfolio and balancing between acreage trades, but then divesting longer-dated stuff that we're not going to get to for a while."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Neal Shah . And with my follow-up, I wanted to focus on ops, perhaps for Joey. Could you elaborate on how you're using predictive analytics and machine learning to improve E&C efficiencies and comment on the maturity of this technology and progressing your efficiencies today."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Joey Hall Yeah, I'd love to. I really appreciate that que stion. I'll give one specific example. When you look at the waterfall charts of where we're getting our cost reductions, now it's not big things, it's a bunch of little things. And one example of where we use predictive analytics was on our chemicals for our whenever we're delivering our stimulations on our wells. We've gone back and use machine learning to determine based on what the outcome is during the delivery of the frack, how we can throttle back our chemicals on the well and thus use less chemical. And whenever you look at that on an individual well basis it may not be big bucks, but when you multiply those times 500, it turns into a huge dollar. Another on the drilling side, we have a stuck pipe predictive tool, where we've gone back and looked at the events where we've had stuck pipe and the drilling activity. And by doing that, we could use machine learning and predictive analytics to know how we can see that coming and thus prevent it. And it's been hugely successful for us. And I could go on and name numerous examples. So I would say from my perspective that it's a very mature methodology that we have adopted and used continuously, but the opportunities for their limitless and we continue to expand it. So appreciate the question, but no, it's been a huge success for us and we look forward to its benefits going forward."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Paul Cheng . . Two questions please. And the first one, on the cash pack. Did I hear it right, that in 2023 you still not going to be a cash taxpayer in any meaningful way because the [Indiscernible] and NOL looked like, you will fully use up in next year?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Neal Shah No, Paul, you're right. It's -- I think you misheard it. We actually do become a cash tax payer in 2023."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,Paul Cheng I see. And at that point then what kind of tax rate that -- cash tax rate that we should assume?
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Neal Shah Well, we'll have the -- you have the 21% and then 1% stay and then we do have a deferred tax liability that starts to filter in at probably 2024 and beyond so I mean, you'll have those impacts that way into the model as well. But we'll become a full cash tax payer in 2023."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,Paul Cheng So 100% of your reported tax will be cash tax by '23?
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Neal Shah Yeah. I'd say it for slightly a smaller portion than that, but then it does step up."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,Neal Shah And we have determined deferred tax liability that will be rolling off.
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Paul Cheng The second question is on the Delaware assets, do you have a EBITDA contribution from those assets in the third quarter, you can share or at a minimum, can you tell us that on a per BOE basis, is that at a lower EBITDA margin I assume campaign to your overall portfolio? And also just curious that if new already plan to sell those assets, why increased or during activity and the rig activity in the third quarter relate to those assets, forward that this deal just come unexpected and on the oil much during attend, you had thought."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Neal Shah stacks up, and in terms of the cash flow basis I don't have the exact third quarter numbers so we'd have to get back to you on that."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"David Deckelbaum  everyone for taking the questions this morning. I just wanted to follow up on one of the longer-term points maybe that you were making earlier, Scott. As you accrue more and more cash and you get below that leverage target, and theoretically if we're entering this world of limited spare capacity, $80 plus, $100 crude, The 75% excess free cash payout beyond the base dividend is still like a very good long-term vision. We would just think about future cash accrued being either used opportunistically and ordered for buybacks over time, or just used to support sort of a base dividend increase at that point, particularly as you get to a point where you' re debt-free."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Scott Sheffield I think you'll see a combination of us over time in that strong commodity price market shift from variable to base. And 1. Secondly, you'll see us in the $80 plus market, just to give you an idea. We're easily have over $10 billion of firepower to buy back stock at various prices. And so I just showed you the potential of firepower that we have over and above distributing 80% of our free cash flow for both base and variable over time. So we're starting to see additional dividend funds invest. We're starting to see our ownership change more and more dividend funds are buying PXD stock for the dividends. Secondly, we're starting to see more retail come in. We're making all that effort to go into all the firms trying to get more retail to shift into PXD because of the dividend yield. But we still think it's important to reduce the share count overtime to -- that's another way besides growing 5% a year, to increase EBITDA to reduce the share count, to increase EBITDA."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"David Deckelbaum Certainly, I appreciate that, Scott. And then maybe just a follow-up, maybe just a little bit in the weeds. But maybe this is for you, Joey, but interested just as we've seen, more private activity in the Permian. And in general pick-up significantly outpacing public activity. Has any private activity that's increasing in and around your acreage position and Midlands created sort of increased downtime that you hadn't necessarily planned for in '21?"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,Joey Hall No. We stay in pretty close contact the private operators as well and but now it hasn't impacted us at all.
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Bertrand Donnes , guys.  for sneaking me in at the end. I'll just ask one so you can wrap it up. Could you maybe just talk about yourself positioning for the retail investor. I think you may have addressed it a little bit, but is that mostly just covered by maybe ESG initiatives. You have strong shareholder returns and then you are broadcasting kind of the disciplined commentary, which is very well appreciated. But is there anything else going on behind the scenes that maybe we're not privy to that retailers"
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Rich Dealy It's a . And I think you can tell by the slide deck and how we positioned the discussion on the variable plus the base, how we view the return of capital and that yield to be competitive, not across on the institutional investor, but as with the retail investor. So we are taking steps and we're making those overtures and we've had discussions with some of the private wealth managers across some of the large institutions and we will continue to do so. And I think we've had a lot of traction there, we've had a lot of discussions there and a lot of positive momentum and a lot of positive feedback, which is really part of how you've seen us position as Scott pointed, the increase in the base dividend, as well as the continued focus on the variable dividend. So there has been traction, there has been a number of inbound calls and we've made a number of outbound overtures as well in discussions. So it's our hope and our anticipation that you'll see increased retail presence within Pioneer equity holder."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Bertrand Donnes Sounds good. It sounds like they appreciate the yield. That's all from me, guys. ."
4465560,Pioneer Natural Resources Company,PXD,11/4/2021,CEO Scott Sheffield on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Rich Dealy They do. Certainly, they do. . That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Scott Sheffield at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Again,  everyone for listening to probably one of the best quarters in Pioneer's history. I know we will see you again until early next year. And so I hope everybody have a happy holiday and travel safely. Again, . This concludes today's call.  for your participation. You may now disconnect."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza Just a couple of questions here. Vince, how should we think about the allocation of that $1 billion in new CapEx both geographic and shaping over time? And will you be able to guide on Rhode Island CapEx right out of the gate in February and March when the deal closes or there'll need to be a bit more time to get your plan in motion?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi Yes, Shar. Did you say organic or inorganic moves?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi Yeah. I just want to make sure I heard your question properly. So, I would say in general as we think about the capital allocation [Indiscernible] investing in the utilities is our priority and our bias, especially as we try to make sure that we're delivering [Indiscernible] that our customers need as we look at the transition to a Clean Energy future. So being able to fund that in a way that requires little to no equity issuances over the foreseeable future is incredibly important to us which is really how Joe and the team identify the $3.5 billion of debt that we bought down with part of the proceeds and getting the Balance Sheet in that position where we can fund not only this billion, but even incremental capital to your point with Rhode Island and other potential opportunities that we may identify without issuing equity. So that's the first component of that. In terms of the stock buybacks themselves, again, we're looking at that versus other potential opportunities. And you mentioned inorganic. I talked about last quarter; we don't need M&A to hit the growth profile that we've communicated. Of course, we will be opportunistic as we always have been with M&A. But our -- I would say our focus in the M&A area right now, Shar, is to close Rhode Island, get the integration underway, and really ensure that we have a smooth transition there. And then as we talked about before, working with the state on the pace of change for the Clean Energy transition up in Rhode Island and then making sure that we're supporting that with the capital and investment plans. So, our focus, I would say, on M&A right now is squarely on that. But as I always say, you never say never. If there's an opportunity that presents itself that we think would create incremental shareholder value above our organic growth plans, certainly it's something that we would consider as we've done in the past; but it's not the core of our strategy right now."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza That's perfect. I appreciate it. It seems like you guys are tightening up that gap between rate base and earnings. So, it's good. . Appreciate it."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Zimbardo  for the time, I have a two-part question, just to clarify Slide 5. Should we be adjusting utility CapEx category for effectively 50% equity content or it's a way that you built some Balance Sheet strength? And also, is it also effectively a toggle that for every incremental dollar of utility CapEx that reduces buyback capacity?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joe Bergstein Yeah. So, Paul, clearly what we announced today was a billion dollars of total buybacks by year-end and at least a billion dollars of incremental capital investments. And we've identified some more potential beyond that, but we need to continue the analysis and work through the business plans. The range that you have, you see on that slide, are really just to provide some context to you on the remaining proceeds in those buckets. And so, as we think about cash and the use of that cash, there's other considerations that we have think about, you know credit, timing of that spend, regulatory mechanisms, broader efficiencies across the largely domestic platform, and all of that will go into our full plan. So, I think once -- we'll be in a better position post the close of Narragansett to discuss the additional details and including how we deploy that remaining proceeds and what falls into each of those pockets."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Zimbardo Okay. I understand. And then you've mentioned the incremental capitals, primarily transmission and distribution. Just wondering if you could frame the Kentucky generation opportunities through 2026 and 2031 from the priority base case you present."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi [Indiscernible] so for -- through 2028, I would say, certainly through '24 which is our next projected coal plant retirement. We don't think we require significant, if any, replacement generation for our '24 retirements. So really the reserve margin starts to tighten when we start to get into the 2028 timeframe. And so, as you can see in the -- on Slide 18, which is the IRP megawatts that we're talking about under the base case and then the high case. Over the 15-year period, which is really where again, it's post 28 when you see more significant retirements and then ultimate replacement for the increase in energy that we're projecti ng, both in the base case and then in the high case. We're thinking in the base case, there's probably around $3 billion up investment opportunity over that 15-year period. Significantly more in the high case, obviously, you're seeing 5600 additional megawatts significantly more renewables in that case, and so the investment opportunity under high case would be -- call it around $10 billion plus or minus, so that's a significant opportunity. As we -- I should clarify, that like the Ford announcement, and some of the other announcements I talked about we're not necessarily in the base case. They don't necessarily get us to the high case. As again, the high case has EV assumptions, and electric heat assumptions, very high gas prices over that sustained period. Obviously, all of that is still to be determined but I would say the positive thing with the Ford and the other announcements I talked about, at least on the major new customer additions were certainly trending towards the high case versus the base case. So, the investment opportunity calls it $3 to $10 billion depending on the cases. Not a significant amount in the next 5 years. You might start to see some in 2026 as we plan for the 2028 retirees. But it's really, I would say, just following that time period is when you'll see more significant investment."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Zimbardo . That's very helpful. Plus, the FERC comment. Looking forward to seeing you all virtually next week, hopefully in person next year.  again."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Hey, Vince. . I just had one question. All of the other stuff has been asked and you answered those. Just previously you've highlighted a potential perspective range of EPS growth trajectory, comparing PPL's forward-looking findings growth rate to peers. Obviously now, you've talked about the additional equity share buybacks, the CapEx plan is higher. Can you share your thoughts there on what my bet trajectory, the range that EPS growth might fall under?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi Yes. I would just reiterate, I think, what we've talked about in the past. We've said we expect to have a competitive EPS growth rate off of our '22 midpoint when we come out with that, and as you know, that range is anywhere from 4% to 8%. But I would say most of the ranges within that are even tighter in the 5% to 7% range, and so we would expect to be solidly in that range."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Okay. . And just really one quick one. After this announ cement of the $500 million in additional share buy back and the $1 billion in CapEx, we're left with roughly $1 billion in proceeds that still need to be deployed. Is that accurate?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joe Bergstein Going with a billion dollars of capital, your kind of around a billion dollars [Indiscernible] numbers through cash. But we'll continue to evaluate [Indiscernible] use of those billion dollars and the [Indiscernible] more details when we -- after the close of Narragansett."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi Way and combining that with underground high-voltage transmission. And so, for us, it's not about the size of the investment, it's for -- it's really a way for us to be part of an innovative project that hopefully could cut through some of those issues that we all know plague many transmission projects. And so, we're really trying to --"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Patterson I hear you on that. In fact, I'm similar familiar with the project and it does sound -- it sounds awesome, frankly, in terms of just what you talked about. It sounds . There are 2 issues that I want to ask you about, in terms of the project. And that is there are these 2 complaints that they filed at FERC regarding, I think one is the PJM Interconnection. In other words, just what you said, the project sounds fascinating. It's merchant, it's underground, it's the right-of-way, it's everything you are talking about. What they seem to be complaining though about, is that PJM has this system impact study stuff that's delaying stuff, as you know. They're saying it could be up to three years. The other one is this capacity complaint that they've got, about the -- how they're going to be treated an external resource in the [Indiscernible] market. And so, my question I guess is, with respect to those 2, because I assume you guys have done due diligence even though it may not be that bigger of a project. And so, you guys might have  -- I would assume you guys have more insight than I do about what you think -- how you think those 2 complaints are going to unfold because it seems like they do have the potential to have a significant impact on the economics of the project or at least at the timing of the project. And I've been following this case. I mean they've had testimony go back and forth and what have you. And I just was wondering if you guys had any insight in terms of how you guys are viewing those complaints regarding those 2 issues: the system impact study, and I think it's facility study, 1, and 2. this external capacity treatment that they're seeking to get."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Dudkin Really not too much to talk about. But I guess from a high level, Paul, for us to or for the United States to really get to being much greener and really reducing the carbon footprint, we're going to need a lot more transmission. So, I think these issues brought up on SOO Green project are probably going to be beyond just this project. Those are the types of issues that need to be resolved if we are to really expand the use of renewables and ultimately expand our transmission system."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Patterson Okay. Fair enough. I -- this sounds like an exciting project. I thought I'd be able to pick your brain a little bit. I appreciate the time, and congratulations on the ROE settlement. That seems like a pretty good deal you guys negotiated there in the Pennsylvania transmission ROE. That's it for me.  so much."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Ryan Levine What's the average price of the $500 million share buyback to-date that you're able to buy in those shares?
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Levine And then as you're looking out at -- you mentioned that you're moving towards the high case in Kentucky. From what you're seeing, is there a way to kind of quantify the load upside from additional development within your service territory? And are you seeing any early indications of what post COVID load patterns are in your footprint that may inform some of those fees?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi Yes. So on -- just in general on the load, I think what we're seeing [Indiscernible] PA we're seeing kind of C&I come back to pretty close to pre - COVID levels. They are a little bit short as you -- we have slides in the deck that show the load and that's really -- things that you're seeing across the country. So, retail and hospitality that those have not fully come back yet. We're seeing the same thing down in Kentucky on that with the commercial. Industrial in Kentucky of course, just a lot of the shutdown issues that we had during COVID, that's all recovered. But with the chip shortages and some of the supply chain issues, we're seeing some of the factories being turned back. So that's why a little bit short on the C&I side. And then on the residential, we're just seeing in Pennsylvania a lot more workers are still working from home and what we're seeing in Kentucky. So, for the most part, Kentucky is back to pre - COVID. Again, it's a little bit positive, but in PA, we're still quite a bit positive. So, we'll -- we're still waiting to see how much of that remains permanent, Ryan, in terms of load, in terms -- with hybrid work schedules and just more flexibility that companies are providing their workforce. So, I guess our expectation would be that residential stays slightly above, but that remains to be seen. And then in terms of the announcements that we talked about, probably a little premature to talk about the low, the exact load impacts on those and when they will cut, and when that will show up. We really in the case of Ford plant, the final designs need to be prepared and released. So, I think while certainly qualitatively this is positive for our jurisdiction in the state in general, and I think it will be it'll actually fuel, additional announcements and opportunities for folks that want to come into the state. Again, we're on top of the E3 energy strategy that the governor announced, I think this all goes very well for economic development opportunities within Kentucky, which I think qualitatively is good for our jurisdictions in our service areas. But putting that into, say, a megawatt of load, I think it's a little premature for that. But as soon as we can do that, we will get that disclosure out."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Levine Appreciate the color. And then last one for me, you mentioned some of the -- you highlighted some of the supply chain issues. They're impacting some of the manufacturers in your service territory. But in terms of kind of implementation of the acceleration of CapEx, are you seeing any limitations from supply chain that could kind of pace there or change the pace of implementation of your -- some of your spending?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Dudkin Yeah, we're starting to see some extended lead times on some select material and equipment, but we've been able across our footprint, to extend the supplier base and mitigate that to some degree. But we're really not experiencing significant delays in current projects, and don't expect an impact on our increased capital plan, going forward."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman Hello. . Hey, . So, couple of questions. First of all, you obviously did not win [Indiscernible] nor do I know if you even bid for it. So just in terms of your thinking on assets, could you maybe -- it's just a good -- the way to maybe talk about why that wasn't something that you were interested in."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi Yes, Steve, I don't think it's appropriate to talk about specific M&A opportunities in the market or even hypotheticals for that matter. So, I would just say, on the M&A front, we're focused on Rhode Island and getting that."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi Not only to complete it but then, the transition to happen in very smooth way and then get off the TSAs and get fully under our ownership. So that's where our focus is."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman Okay. Secondly, just going back to that Slide 5 and just to make sure I understand what you're showing here. The additional utility CapEx, that's an asset number, that's not an equity number. Only half of that would be equity roughly. I'm not sure you're actually using all $10.4 billion of cash proceeds when you had the stuff up then or am I -- how do I interpret? Because you're kind of mixing asset with equity?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi I think to your point and just to solidify what Joe is saying, So, when we look at that $1 to $2 billion and this is kind of to your point, I think. We can fund that range without additional equity going forward, so."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Vincent Sorgi And that I think that's kind of to you --
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Vincent Sorgi That's kind of to your point. I think.
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman Kind of. I guess, another way to ask a quest -- that question is, I think you targeted your debt paydown, is this too pretty strong high tripled [Indiscernible] metrics for the amount of debt paydown. So, you've a lot of debt paydown. And then the investment of the additional equity or the additional proceeds, you got kind of feathers in over time. If you use '22 as a base, you're not really putting all this money to work. And it makes it like almost a little bit of not really the base in a way. So, in theory, if you're growing the same as other utilities off that base, you should be growing just because you haven't put a lot of your money to work at or some trunk of your money back to work. I was just trying to think about if you're going to base the growth off '22, it just -- it's not really a new base."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joe Bergstein But certainly, we're putting -- we'll put the money to work on the acquisition of Narragansett, the buybacks are [Indisc ernible]."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joe Bergstein And the debt reductions complete. So, it's significantly behind us and so if you think about the opportunity, I don't know if it is different than any other utilities that has a forward capital plan that hasn't deployed the capital yet. So, I do think it is the base. We have transitioned and TSA and other costs that are in there that are a little different. But as far as utilizing the proceeds, I expect that the lion's share of those will be utilized by the time we get to the close of Narragansett, and provide a forecast and a base year and a growth rate."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell Good, Vince. This maybe our year six [Indiscernible] I know it's early though. Just -- if I can follow up on Steve's question, and I apologize going back to Slide 5. If I just think about that slide and the additional CapEx you announce today, a billion dollars in the share buybacks total of billion dollars a year. What's left of the proceeds is $700 million. Am I thinking of that correctly?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Anthony Crowdell So then do you have the ability to do $2 billion of share buybacks if what's left is $700 million?
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joe Bergstein I think we do. But again, the intent of this page was to get broad buckets of how we're thinking about the opportunity with the proceeds. And so, I think these all kind of questions get back to the same point. I have to reiterate that we're not through with the business plan yet. So, we're trying to provide some level of detail to you in the interim as we think about this and we work through the plans, putting the  -- Vince talked about this. Putting those proceeds, if you will, to the capital, we think is a better use of that capital ultimately to do the work that we need to do on the system and provide the network that customers need and do it in an affordable way. But we're not done and we just need to work through the full of the plan."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell Okay. But you're -- I'm not just thinking share buyback even like if you had an incremental utility CapEx up to $2 billion, another $1 billion, so you've got the $2 billion. If you hit that $2 billion, that would be er than the proceeds, the 10 fours. Is that accurate?"
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi Yes. But again, the balance sheet is set up so that we can fund our CapEx growth without issuing equity. So, the balance sheet is strong enough to fund all that, Anthony."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Anthony Crowdell Got it. And then just -- last question. One of the earlier questions I [Indiscernible] talked about maybe the timing of the incremental CapEx and think it's split evenly between Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Just about total thinking about getting that CapEx into rates. I believe in Kentucky; you did have a [Indiscernible] for a couple of years. Just talk about how do you get that additional CapEx into rates.
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Vincent Sorgi Yes. So, the -- I think Greg said it was relatively evenly split across the years, not between PA and Kentucky. I think this initial billion we've identified is actually more weighted to Pennsylvania than it is Kentucky, [Indiscernible]."
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Anthony Crowdell .  so much for taking my question guys and looking forward to seeing [Indiscernible] EI.
4465563,PPL Corporation's,PPL,11/4/2021,CEO Vincent Sorgi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Joe Bergstein . This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince Sorgi for some closing remarks. , just want to thank everyone for joining us on the call and we're looking forward to engaging with everybody next week at EI. So, , everybody. The conference is now concluded.  for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rich Hightower , guys. I'm still with Evercore ISI. So a lot of statistics thrown out in the prepared comments, so  for the detail there. Maybe give us a sense -- there's a lot of time spent on the improvement in the urban and downtown segments of the portfolio and maybe give us a sense there of where you stand in October. And I guess, even November so far in terms of rate and occupancy versus the same period in 2019. And do you expect those hotels to bridge that gap in the same way that the leisure and resort segments have already done? Do you think that that gap could be fully bridged sometime next year? Is that a 2023 event? How do we think about that? ."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Sourav Ghosh Yeah. Hey, Rich, I can give us some color at least on the BT front as it relates to October, specifically. We do expect October to be the strongest [indiscernible] month for 2021, approximately 6000 room nights was all we have on the books for BT, and that's a 17% increase over September. If you recall, from the beginning of the year from January through July, we had about on average a 30% sequential improvement in BT room nights every single month. We saw a slight increase from July to August, and then a slight dip from August to September. But now we have picked up and back on the trajectory that we had seen early on in the year. So very encouraged. And as Jim talked about our overall BT rate is actually up 5% quarter-over-quarter, and that's holding strong. As it relates to 2019, we're about call it around 50% of 19 levels as we stand right now and we expect that to continue to improve with every single quarter going forward."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Smedes Rose Hi, it's Smedes with Citi. Sourav, you gave a lot of specifics around labor and cost ratios, which we'll probably going to look through in more detail. But I guess in general, I just wanted to ask you about the pace of labor costs, particularly for hourly workers, and tying that back to your initial cost savings [Indiscernible] you tell me if this is fair, but it seems that labor, it definitely moves higher than maybe what those -- some of those initial goals were provided. And I'm just wondering if it takes you longer to get said cost-savings target or have you just been able to offset and replaced the cost with other savings?"
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Sourav Ghosh I'm sure Smith you are breaking up there a little bit, but I think I got your question. On the labor front. What I'll start off with sort of end with $100 million to $150 million that we may have messaged is when we were going into 2020, we were expecting higher than inflationary growth in a few of the Sunbelt markets, and that's obviously pre -pandemic. So as we went through the pandemic there were obviously the rate of acceleration in terms of wage growth in those markets went up. For the portfolios, I can give you some specific numbers here. For the portfolio, I would say, we expect a CAGR from 19% to 22 of about five to 7%. Now I would break that down between urban and Sunbelt markets. For urban, just given a lot of those are covered under the CBA, that would be around 3% to 4% CAGR from 2019 to 2022. In the Sunbelt, that CAGR would be about 6% to 8%. So again, the overall portfolio we expect that CAGR of 2019 to 2022 to be about 5 to 7. Now, as it relates to the 100 million and 115 million that we messaged, remember that was in relation to 2019 revenues and expenses. So reality is, depending on how quickly we get back to 19 levels of revenue, you can see all that benefit come through to the bottom line, obviously, depending on how much inflationary -- above inflationary growth we see in wages and benefits, it w ill be shaved off, and that will impact margin going forward. So hopefully that answers your question."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neil Malkin , everyone. Neil Malkin, Capital One Securities, good to be with you all.  quarter,  announcements. Jim or Sourav, I thought it was pretty impressive that you were able to keep your occupancy fairly steady through the third quarter despite the vicissitudes of the Delta variant impact on particularly the corporate side of demand. Can you just talk about how you were able to do that? And what things -- leverage you were able to pull or what came in better than expected, that allowed you to maintain those occupancies again, despite the dip in the middle of the quarter from a national level? ."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Risoleo Neil [indiscernible] we're very encouraged with the trend line that we're seeing going forward. And I think one of the most encouraging data points with respect to the second half of the year and the third quarter and the four th quarter, was the fact that we were able to maintain 1.2 million group room nights on the books, notwithstanding Delta. So it just points out that there's a lot of pent-up demand in the economy, in general, people want to get back out, they want to meet, they want to travel, we have seen a little bit of a pullback as a result of Delta as everyone else did. But as the Delta trend line started to diminish and we got over the peak and new cases, and people saw that we were going in the same direction as countries in other parts of the world were, they got back on the road. So there's no magic to it. I think one of the -- and we've talked about this a lot. The quality of our assets is really second to none. And the fact that we have continued to invest capital in our portfolio, we think is going to be a true competitive advantage as business really starts to open up. I mean, I said it in my prepared remarks with respect to market share gains as we embarked upon the Marriott transformational Capital Program back in '17 and '18, we underwrote 3 to 5 points, pick up in RevPAR yield index. That was pre -pandemic. Now that we're going to have a portfolio that is largely refreshed, I mean, we have spent $75000 a key on the 21 properties that we referenced, 16 Marriotts and five other assets. We would expect that we'll continue to see strong performance going forward. And I'm optimistic quite frankly, that we'll pick up more than 3 to 5 points in yield index. So I think it's a combination of the quality of our assets to location of our assets. Our asset managers and enterprise analytics team working very closely with the best in the business. Whether it's Marriott, Hyatt, our independent managers that are out there Just really being very thoughtful about revenue management strategies and yield management strategies in getting business in the hotels while maintaining rate integrity. And I think that's a big -- it's another big story as we open up for business again. This pandemic and post-pandemic has been marked by material yield and ADR integrity as opposed to what happened coming out of the  Recession. So we're able to truly asset-manage these hotels and revenue -manage them to maximize RevPAR. And I expect we'll continue to do that going forward."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bill Crow Hey, . Jim, Just curious on the group side, I think yesterday Marriott suggested their group revenues on the books for next year are down roughly 20%, and I think you said your pace is down 46%, rate up just a little bit. Is it a locational issue, is it just the big city-wide, or what creates such a big gap between what Marriott was suggesting for their portfolio and you who own a lot of the Marriott group houses?"
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Risoleo Bill, I don't know if anybody on Host team, I don't know if Sourav listened to the Marriott call. I did not hear what they had to say. But we are at -- for 2022, as we sit here today, we had 54% of our group room nights on the books for next year that we had relative to the same time in 2019 for 2020. So we're encouraged that that number actually ticked up from 50% at the end of our second quarter call to 54% now. So I don't know what Marriott said with respect to pace, but we're actually encouraged. I mean We have roughly 2.6 million group room nights on the books. And if we looked at the same period of time, quarter three 2019, for quarter three 2020, just to give you some context. And this is what we talked about last quarter. We had 68% of our actuals on the books at that point in time I think the real number to look at is 68 to 54. And That's the gap that we're working really hard to close. Does that answer your question, Bill?"
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bill Crow Yeah, . If I could just put a little bit finer point on it. How our New York and San Francisco, in particular, stacking up next year, on a group basis? And then maybe, Sourav, if you could just tell us how much cancellation and attrition fee income was included in the third quarter results that'd be . Appreciate it."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Sourav Ghosh Yeah. We recognize $16 million of attrition cancellations for the quarter.
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Thomas Allen Morgan Stanley. Sir just thinking about the fourth quarter of the RevPAR trends. You talked about November RevPAR dipping business seasonality than back in December. Can you just help us think about the outlook on versus 2019 level and how you see trends going forward?
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Sourav Ghosh So October number is down about 34% to 2019. I'll put this in perspective. I think November, sitting here right now, would get somewhere in the neighborhood of down $5 to $7 from October, and then December, close to October RevPAR. That's what we're thinking, as we said as of today, just based on the data that's available."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Thomas Allen Okay. And then, I mean, typically you haven't given monthly. So is that implying on a versus 2019 level, things are improving as we got through the year, or do you [Indiscernible] and then my follow-up question that I'm going to ask is, the borders are opening next week for more international visitors, are you seeing a material benefit from that and bookings yet or is it too early to tell or too difficult to tell. ."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Sourav Ghosh We have gotten anecdotal commentary on that, speaking with some of our hotels in New York, as well as our San Francisco, I mean, international flight bookings are certainly up 15% since the announcement has taken place. So 6 weeks out from the time of the announcement, the bookings are up 15%. And specifically for San Francisco, that's up 34%, and that compares to what it was 6 weeks before that announcement. So it's encouraging from a hotel's perspective in New York, we've definitely seen a transient pickup and we can attribute pretty meaningful percentage to pick up from Europe specifically. But I don't have any hard numbers yet that I can share."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dori Kesten . . Wells Fargo. Now, that you've exited the covenant waiver period for your credit facility, what barriers exists for returning to paying the common dividend?"
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Risoleo and we realized that dividends are important to a lot of our shareholders. Our policy prior to the pandemic was to pay out 100% of our taxable income. As agreed, we have to pay out 90%. And as we see how business returns, and as we can wrap our arms around the pace of the recovery, we will take that into consideration as we think about reinstating the dividend."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Powell A transaction questions. We haven't got one yet. Just -- the pipeline has been very strong this year, the Big Sur acquisition is attractive. What's the pipeline look like going forward? And as you look at acquisitions going forward, given you exited the covenant waiver, how do you rank incremental debt equity offerings and using your cash balance as sources of funds for those deals?"
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Risoleo Hey Anthony. The pipeline con tinues to be vibrant, I would say. As you know, the deals that we've been able to get done this year have been off-market transactions, and that's where we continue to stay focused right now. Because there is a fair amount of competition out there, given that the debt markets are flushed with cash, the CMBS market in particular, flushed with cash and a lot of the private equity firms were sitting on the sideline waiting for the CMBS markets to come back. So we are starting to see more competition. As we think about sources of capital, we're very, very delighted that we could exit the credit waiver amendment, 3 quarters before exploration. And one of the other data points that we didn't discuss is the fact that we had a debt incurrence test under our bond indenture. As you know, our portfolio is completely unencumbered, so it's all Balance Sheet that and we had a debt incurrence test under our bond indenture that precluded us from getting -- from issuing new debt. Hard to stop until we got back above 1.5 times interest coverage. So we have -- we met that threshold as well. I think it's going to on the margin give us a little more flexibility on the acquisition front. There were several transactions in the market that we worked on last year that had existing debt in place and that debt was prohibitively expensive to break and pay off, so we had to take a pass. But now with the fact that we can acquire assets with that, that gives us another opportunity to look at a few hotels out there that are encumbered with existing financing. So we're very happy with our cash position. We're happy with the fact that we have come out of the credit waiver amendments 3 quarters early. And between cash on hand and the ability to issue new debt, I think that is the direction you would see us going if we continue to deploy capital into new acquisitions."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Anthony Powell Got it. So the bar is higher for ATM now; is that fair?
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Woronka Tapes Deutsche Bank.  for all day points, guys, very helpful. Question is, Jim, you guys scheme out a bunch of data on your acquisition date and how much they're beating initial underwriting. And I think that was a comment probably on 2021. Could you just talk about -- if that's correct, could you talk about whether the expectations for future years have also changed? ."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Risoleo Well, Chris, we are in the middle of the budgeting process. So it's a little early to give you specific numbers, but I would venture that give -- coming off the strong base in 2021 that we're seeing it really every deal that we've acquired this year, that 2022 is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations as well. When we -- when we underwrote the acquisitions throughout the course of this year, we were in a very -- period of  uncertainty. We didn't really have a sense on how Delta COVID was going to behave. And when we, when the country was going to be able to get COVID under control. So, long way of saying that we were conservative in our underwriting. And conservative in our underwriting. But as we looked out to, say '23, '24 and beyond, and the financial performance that we baked into these properties, it penciled on an IRR basis and allowed us to pull the trigger and deploy capital. I think that it's going to be meaningfully better across the board. I mean, if you just look at where we put capital and what's happening in these markets, some of the best highest growing -- highest growth markets in the country with meaningful barriers to new supply. If you think about Alila, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset, to be able to buy that at 9.3 times on this year's EBITDA, an asset that is generating $275,000 a key in EBITDA and we're not seeing any slowdown there. The Four Seasons Resort Walt Disney World, we're just starting to see, the benefits of the celebration the 50th anniversary celebration of Walt Disney World that just kicked off in October. So I expect that we're going to see our performance going forward. And I think that you'll see it across all of the assets we bought that and we're going to continue to see it in our resort portfolio, which is comprised of 16 properties now. And we will see business return to the major urban markets. We've been encouraged there as well this last quarter."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Darling Hi. . I'm with Green Street. Just going back to the Ventana acquisition for a second. You mentioned 8 times to 10 times stabilized EBITDA multiple by about 2025. But given you're acquiring it at just over 9 times multiple, does that imply that this is really the high watermark for the near-term and you might be expecting a dip in performance over the next couple of years? And then also curious if you could comment on the Terniums of the Hyatt management agreement there?"
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Risoleo Well, with respect to the terms of Hyatt's management agreement, that's not something that we're in a position to talk about. Chris, I will tell you that the World of Hyatt is doing an incredible job filling that -- filling Alila Ventana and they were getting between 65% and 75% of our room nights through World of Hyatt redemptions. And as a high redemption hotel, we're getting a -- the premium rate. The highest rate that the property is selling rooms for. So at 59  rooms, that gives us the opportunity to really yield manage, to revenue manage the rooms that are not being sold through the World of Hyatt redemption program. With respect to our stabilized EBITDA multiple, we gave a range of 8 to 10 times. Is 8 doable? I think it is doable. But are we being conservative and throwing a range of 8 to 10 out there? I think that's the way you should think about it."
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ari Klein . BMO. Maybe on the disposition, you sold a few post a quarter and, I guess, or importantly, some others that might be on the market. How should we think about asset sales from here? Have you done most of the heavy lifting? Is there anything else that you'd look to sell?"
4465568,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,11/4/2021,CEO Jim Risoleo on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Risoleo Yeah, Ari. I mean, it's -- real estate alert is always good with publishing a rumored acquisition or a rumor disposition. And I'm very glad that on the?5-pack that? they indicated we were going to sell for $500 million and we ended up selling for $551 million. With respect to future dispositions, I think that you should think about our capital allocation strategy, really with one bottom-line goal in mind. Everything that we do is meant to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio. And if we were to sell other assets, it would be because we believe that we are getting fair value for the assets relative to our whole value, and that by making those dispositions, we can redeploy that Capital either into new acquisitions or into assets that we currently own that are going to grow faster than the rest of the portfolio on average. So as you're thinking about [indiscernible] going forward, I think that's the way -- that's the bottom line. It's all to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joe Vruwink Oh, . Hi, everyone. Just on the points of ANSYS growing in line with the targets, you provided back in 2019, how different is the composition of the growth today relative to the original budget? For instance, something like optical, not around to 2019, now 5% of bookings. Is it true to say there is maybe newer and faster growing contributors to ACV? And if that is true, does it suggest that there is also areas of the business that might be on the lagging end of recovery, and so you get bigger contributors in future years?"
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ajei Gopal Yeah, so when we talked about in 2000, when we gave long-term guidance, if you look at the addressable market, we talked about the core, the foundations of the business. And then, we talked about a high growth adjacencies, including areas such as autonomy, electrification, IoT, 5G. And we talked about some of the investments that we were making. And in particular, we did talk about optical as an area that we were investing in, in particular, to support things like autonomous vehicles, as well as to support things like 5G for the purposes of interconnects, and so forth. And so, we’ve essentially been executing against the strategy that we laid out. I’ll also want to correct a point that you made in your question. You said 5% of the bookings came from optical. That’s not what I said in my script. What I said is that 5% of the deals had some optical component within the within the agreement with the customer. So there was some aspect of optical within that. Optical, of course, is a relatively small piece of our business today."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andrew Obin Just a question. If you look at the numbers, sort of a fairly significant outgrowth in the U.S., relative to the rest of the world. Could you just talk about how this COVID – A, what’s driving it? I assume a lot of it is COVID driven. And how the reopening dynamic could sort of change those going into the yearend and into next year, i.e., what would it take for the rest of the world to catch up with the U.S.? And why is the U.S. so robust? ."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Nicole Anasenes Yeah.  so much for your question, Andrew. So as you pointed out, over the last 12 months, America has continued to be a consistent strong performer, and lead the company in creating value for our customers. A couple of deals with the, one that Ajei mentioned in his remarks, the $58 million agreement with a leading North American technology company is an example of – I think the model that we have exported around the world and leaves some of the strength in our other regions like APAC, where the customer has already been using solutions from across the ANSYS multiphysics portfolio, but is now expanding the number of simulation users. And so, we’ve done a very good job at building deep relationships with customers, understanding their short and their long-term development roadmaps, and enabling them to be able  to propagate the use of simulation to broader use-cases, to connect to physics and to also connect to other users and in the process to leverage that simulation. And so, that model that America executes quite well, is the model that we’re executing around the world. And just as an example, our Asia-Pacific region has executed exceptionally. They had another quarter, a very strong growth with 21%, constant currency growth – I’m sorry, 21% growth in the region at a constant currency basis. And the strength in that region was broad-based across industry, customer types, geographies. We had several 7 figure contracts in Asia Pacific, that added growth to the high-tech sector, where customers are really showing enthusiasm for not just the core portfolio, but the adjacencies as well. So there is a common theme here, where we’re broadening and deepening the relationships within the customer, with our core technology, having strong footholds and solid growth, but also leveraging the organic and the inorganic investments that we’ve been making over the past 5 years, to accelerate the footprint globally. And so, I would say the core strength of the portfolio and the inve stments that we’ve been making, during the course of the pandemic, with our customers and in our portfolio are really the drivers of the acceleration and performance of growth. To some degree, there is a little bit of recovery. It’s that Asia Pacific probably had a little bit ahead in the recovery versus America. There are still unevenness in terms of customers are preferring to meet in person. So I wouldn’t characterize things as returned to normal quite yet. But certainly, the business model is resilient. It is showing through, regardless of the challenges that we’ve seen in the pandemic."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andrew Obin Oh, wow. . So it has much as sort of reopening as structural changes in the business model, is that the right way of reading it?"
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ajei Gopal And I think, just to add one small point to Nicole’s response there, when you think about the investments that customers make in ANSYS, it’s really triggered by their investments in R&D. And obviously, globally, you’re seeing investments in R&D, customers continuing to look at next generation products and offerings, and that’s where simulation comes in. So the fact that we can help them with building their next generation, again, points to the importance of our technology. And that’s what allows us to be in a position to make these relationships and sales during a pandemic, or any other time for that matter."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andrew Obin . And just a follow-up question, I think on a previous call, you guys highlighted how small and medium business sort of tends to lead your core business. And you made some remarks about small and medium. You are continuing to see improvement. But can you just talk about sort of sequential trends in SMB? And what this portend – if you still view it as a leading indicator for the rest of the business go into the yearend and next year? And I know you did improve your 4Q outlook, but just maybe more color there.  so much."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ajei Gopal Yeah. And just to amplify one of the points Nicole made, the large customer dynamic is somewhat different from the SMB. For the most part, the large customer dynamic is driven by the long-term relationships that we’ve maintained with our direct sales-force with these customers. Many of these are long-term customers of ours. They’ve built their processes around ANSYS. And when it comes to a new project, or a new activity, as they start to continue to evolve their R&D efforts, they turn to us as a vendor. And so, there’s an opportunity within those customers to expand the footprint based on long-term relationships. In the case of SMBs, in many cases, the SMBs are relationships that we have through channel partners. And, some of these customers may be relatively new customers. They may be relatively early in their life as an organization. And so, I wouldn’t necessarily say SMB is a leading indicator, which was the point that you made. I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s a leading indicator. These are two different – there are slightly different dynamics across both the SMB and enterprise. And, each one of them has their own go-to-market motion and supporting activity."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gal Munda Yeah. . And  for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, just in terms of the raised ACV guidance that we’re seeing, again, you did a second time in a row, kind of becoming material. I was just wondering what enabled you that. Is it this trend that you’ve seen in SMB in Q3 or – and also, coupled with strength in Asia that you mentioned? Or is it just the outlook? As you look into Q4, you mentioned the pipeline looks really strong in terms of what’s still to come in Q4 versus what you originally expected?"
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Nicole Anasenes Sure. So, in Q3, we had a really strong Q3 as you point out with that strong double-digit growth. Q3 ACV did come in line really close within our expectations. And so, the raise on ACV in Q4 is really a function of the improved momentum that has been building since the last time we shared guidance  in August, across the board. And so, what I would say is when you look at how we delivered year to date and in the quarter, it’s been pretty broad-based across industries and customers. And, that’s kind of the reflection of what I would characterize the momentum in Q4. There is not any isolated one-off thing that is driving that view. It is more kind of an overall momentum building that you’ve been seeing, as you rightly point out, we’ve been able to raise throughout the year, I mean, as you recall in the beginning of the year, we still were not sure whether what the kind of dynamics around recovery were going to look like. And so, we’ve been kind of sharing with you as we see things ahead of us, and systematically raising expectations over time."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jason Celino Hi,  for taking my question. Related to Zemax, I’d be curious on how that acquisition came together? I know in the past, you said that sometimes customers make requests. And I was wondering if this was one of those instances, and then maybe a quick follow-up, Zemax contribution on an annual basis? Is it fair to think its $24 million to $26 million of it is annualized the contribution for Q4? ."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Nicole Anasenes Yeah, so I can quickly answer that question on the contribution. So we expect – so we had – as we’ve sai d, we think it’ll have about $6 million to $8 million of ACV impact and revenue impact. This year, which will be offset by – largely offset by currency. Next year, we’re estimating an incremental approximately $20 million in organic impact."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Wong Got it. Really appreciate the color there. And, Nicole, just wanted to touch on the higher mix of perpetual, is that simply a snapback to suppress perpetual buying from 2020? Or is there some other element causing that that higher perpetual mix?"
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Nicole Anasenes Yeah, no, I would characterize it, as you recall perpetual licenses during the pandemic did take a quite a significant hit, particularly in the first 3 quarters of last year. And so they did recover quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year, which is one of the reasons why the compares a little more challenging in Q4. But customers continue to prefer time based licensing models, because it really enables them to be more flexible as their needs evolve. And so over the past several years, the business model has really been shifting away from perpetual licenses. If you look over longer periods of time, it’s been pretty flat. And the growth has been primarily through the acceleration of leases. And so that’s really built a very strong annuity business for us over the past 5 years, and has been a very successful evolution of the business. And so, while we did see – we are seeing kind of some of the compare effects in the first 3 quarters of this year, we believe over the long-term that the shift that customer – we’re seeing from customers is going to continue towards that lease-based licensing."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jackson Ader .  for taking my questions, guys. Actually just, if we can follow up on, I mean, I know there has been a lot of questions on the cloud. But if we think about, if there are more deals that shift to either the ANSYS cloud or maybe through your partnership with Microsoft, how would that actually impact the revenue line items? And is there any kind of a difference in recognition, depending on where the cloud deployment is?"
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ajei Gopal And the way we built our product, Jackson, is that customers can bring their own licenses, right? So it turns, you can seamlessly take advantage of both ANSYS cloud compute capabilities as well as you can take advantage of the same license running on premises. And so, the fact that we give you the flexibility of managing that, that’s what customers are looking for. And so, we’re not asking them to give up their investments in their on-prem compute. If they’ve got that, that’s . They can take advantage of that. In addition, they can take advantage of cloud. Or if they want to choose to completely take advantage of the cloud, they can do that too. So that flexibility is what customers are looking for, and we’re in a position to support them with that."
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jackson Ader Okay, that makes sense. And then, a follow-up on DYNA. So the use-cases that we’re kind of talking about here are different and are expanded from what we probably would have thought when you first acquired LS-DYNA, right down the middle, crash and impact. Is the malleability of the DYNA solver specific to DYNA or is this also something that like other solver portfolios can do, they can kind of be flexible outside of their core use-case?"
4465576,"ANSYS, Inc.'s",ANSS,11/4/2021,CEO Ajei Gopal on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ajei Gopal Yeah, I’m not sure what you mean by the malleability. I think that, firstly, DYNA provided an explicit analysis capability into the portfolio, which obviously has use-cases, of wide variety of use-cases. And we’ve continued to expand those use-cases within the ANSYS portfolio as we’ve integrated the technologies together, and combine both explicit and implicit capabilities. It broadens the addressable opportunity. So that’s obviously the case. I think perhaps you might be referring to the announcements we – the comment I made about Fujitsu. And I think in that, what is important to recognize is that the DYNA solver is available on the Fujitsu machine, on their PRIMEHPC supercomputer. And essentially because that machine is efficient, we can help our customers, because they’re supporting DYNA on the – they’re supporting their large-scale DYNA runs on the Fujitsu hardware platform. And that’s more efficient, because they can offload some of their simulation workload onto to an efficient compute platform. So that was the point on that piece, and hopefully, that clarifies the comment about Fujitsu."

I guess, first of all, on the communication side, you guys talked about some higher costing jobs impacting margins. First of all, can you quantify that? And then do you see that coming back on track as we go into the fourth quarter '22? And then on the Industrial Services side, I think you talked about some storm issues impacting results. Is that business still profitable or was that business profitable in the third quarter? And just lastly, on the Canadian projects that you called out, just want to confirm whether there were -- were charges taken or was this just a working capital swing and were those DSOs normalized?"

I think when we look at the Telecom business, we did call it out [Indiscernible] we're operating from mid single-digits instead of upper-single to double-digits when we looked at it.

The closeouts on a few projects are very difficult but the large majority or the vast majority of the business is performing in those double-digit margins and offsetting anything there as minimal, as we said on the call, from a charge standpoint or really just cost standpoint when we close things out. We'll go from there, but I do think we added backlog. We continue to build backlog in this segment. We see a long runway there and we did start up some wireless capabilities, it has some cost in it. In general, incidental to the Company, incidental to the segment, we like the market long-term, we will get into double-digits there over time. Canada, when we looked at Canada, I think in general, the projects are performing well. We still see some COVID effects there to the Delta variant on some of those projects. There is some delays in getting billing cycles, billing points there as we run through a project, I think. So that it's more of a billing issue of when can we get things build versus any problems with the project or charges. We did not take charges on Canadian projects. We performed very well. And the storm, yes, it did have a positive effect to the electric segment. It does when we get storms like that, it was up a little bit bigger than last year from the standpoint. Fairly large storm for us, I think it shows our collaborative effect with the client, how we've got in and work our front-end services, we're still working the storm for our clients. It just shows the longevity of the Company and what we've done on the front side of the business to collaborate with the client, to get things up faster, to do a nice job there for them. And I think we performed very well there. Offset, but it did have some impact on some of our underground segments as it always does when it comes in. So you get some offset and you also come off some larger work to go pick up storm. So those things offset some in the quarter."

And then just my second question is a little bit longer term. It has to do with labor. Clearly there's a lot of work coming down the pipe to de -carbonize the U.S. and you guys have the Northwest Lineman College. But just trying to understand just your strategy for scaling labor. Maybe you could start off with how much throughput do you have into your ranks from Northwest Lineman College. And then how can you scale that program to meet that future labor needs? And then lastly, maybe you can talk about whatever innovations or technology you have to minimize or actually improve labor productivity of your workers and your business."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Duke Austin [Indiscernible] I think if you're just now trying to scale labor, you're long ways behind. We've spent about $150 million over the last 5 years and we're way ahead of that. So in my mind, we've done that. We've proven that we grow the Company, that's who we are. This is craft skilled labor, and not labor. In my mind, we self-perform about 85-90% of our business for a reason. And it's this reason, when you get tight labor markets, we can perform, we could perform on time, on budget, and give our client what they're asking for which is certainty. And we're doing that on a daily basis. That's why we're collaborating, that's why you're seeing expansion. As far as productivity, I'll put our margins up against it and show the growth of the Company, the growth of our internal labor force. The 3,000 or 5,000 that we add every year to that labor force is proof that we can do it, we can scale it. We are scaling it and the productivi ty speaks for itself, and the margins."

As it relates to higher DSOs due to the cost in delays on the two Canadian electrical transmission projects, can you address your confidence in collecting on these and what the likely timing of that will be?"
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sean Eastman Hi Gentlemen,  for taking my questions. I feel like coming through earnings here just a lot of concerns around the renewables supply chain. I know you guys obviously just completed a big acquisition tied to renewable development into next year. I guess just in light of what you're seeing in the supply chain, could you maybe update us on how much cushion you think you have in that 2022 Blattner outlook that you framed back in September. Do you think that outlook is bias to the upside or is that looking increasingly realistic at this point?"
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Duke Austin If you said 2,5 to 2,7, we standby it. We standby today. We know more about the Company today than we did when we talked about it before. We feel highly confident in those numbers. And I would just say, in general, yes, there is some supply chain noise, is what I would call it, and I think us having the breadth of Quanta, the breadth of Blattner is only from my standpoint helps us to add to who we are. It adds to how we can go execute. And I want to also say, when we think about Blattner and we think about this long term, we're looking 20 years and we've given guidance out. Not only do we stand by the 2-6 2-7 that we've given, which also gave a 2025 guidance of 3.6. We stand by that even more today."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sean Eastman Okay. Fair enough, Duke.  for that. And maybe you could comment on how Luma is trending relative to what they need to be doing to capture those performance incentives. Could that be upside in the fourth quarter? I'm just not exactly sure how that works. And obviously, a lot of noise in the headlines still. So  to get an update there."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Duke Austin Yes. So Luma, we expected noise in the headlines. I think we've said that from the start, and as you transition to these large transitions on an island, it does have some noise to it. We're performing very well underneath the governor, the government is very much behind it. What we're doing is the right thing. We will transition that all into a modern system. We're doing so every single day, you can't get the payments on the upside of those payments until we get into a full contract which doesn't go into a full contract until bankruptcy's declared out of bankruptcy, and then it goes into a 15-year contract. But as we stand today, we are in a contract that just has not started on the 15 years until they come out of bankruptcy. There was some favorable rulings on the bankruptcy proceedings in the last week or so, I believe. Really good stuff going on underneath, a little noisy on the top, primarily around the generation which we don't control. I feel confident in our ability to perform there and what we're doing for the people that [Indiscernible]"
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neil Mehta , team. I want to spend a little time on transmission and there is breaking news of the whole thing of the NECEC transmission project. And do you [Indiscernible] foresee some risks the electric power top-line growth in the future due to regulatory concerns around large project activity in transmission, and any of the current projects that you're working on facing similar risks that we should be aware of?"
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Duke Austin I look at it like this. I saw [Indiscernible] most of our clients either add to their $20 billion of backlog over time, of what they're going to build in the CapEx and OpEx over the quarter. Almost every single one of them added to what they're trying to do from an energy transition. The large projects may get headlines and people want to talk about them. We're right around the edges on every one of them. They are additive to anything we said. The 85% of our business that still exist today, is -- the MSA work, those capital spend, there's undergrounding, what Energy said yesterday on [Indiscernible], those kind of things and with the tight labor supply. So any headline you're reading or what you read into something on la rge projects. It's not affecting the underlying business in our growth trajectories. We've given good guidance on that. The 85% mid-upper single-digits, you can look at our track record over the last 5-6 years and see what it looks like. I expect that going forward."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neil Mehta That's really clear and  for saying that. The follow-up is around the budget reconciliation package. Would spending from both the budget reconciliation package, depending on what form it takes, and the bipartisan infrastructure build directly drive project activity that Quanta could be involved in? And that's over and above the base case growth that you talk about."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Duke Austin I think you're going through energy transition, as we said. And I think the sentiment around North America and around what we're hearing, even in Canada, you're seeing more and more transition. And as you go into EVs, as you go into your renewables coming on, and you are also doubling load over time. And I think that's the unknown, is people don't understand that you're doubling load, and you're going to a carbon free fuel source. So as you do  those things, you're going to need hydrogen, you're going to need tons of renewables. And I think in order to do that, you got to how transmission and we're sitting in very, very good spaces in all these areas. And it allows us through policy or without policy, we'll continue to see that sentiment move forward. That's what we see. I do think when both the five and plan. The plans that we've seen are additive to anything we said."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jamie Cook Hi. . I guess, two questions. One sort of short-term once or a longer-term. First, Derrick, can you help us understand the Industrial business or stronghold business. What is implied for the revenue in sort EBITDA, if any contribution in your 2021 guidance and just the opportunity for that business to be more accretive to margins and earnings as we look to 2022. And then my second question Duke, just longer term is, as we think about good long-term secular trends. You have Blattner, infrastructure etc. Could you sort of help us reframe how you're thinking about the electric power margins, over the longer-term, and is there more of an upward bias versus how you've thought about margins historically? ."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Derrick Jensen Yeah, as it relates to -- go ahead, Jamie."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Derrick Jensen I was just going to say, relative to the fourth quarter, I think it would be slightly profitable, which is what we have said, that they could be back and returning into a degree of profitability overall. That group is at slightly north of $500 million for '21 going into '22. I think we see it having the ability to start to return to the degree of normalcy that we talked about in the past. Those numbers have been north of a $700 million number. I don't know quite yet. It's too early to comment as to whether we'll get into those type levels, but I think we'll definitely see an increase. And we would see that it would be largely returning to some of that historical profitability again. I want to see how this fourth quarter plays out though."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jamie Cook And sir, can you remind me how you're thinking about historic profitability for strongholds?"
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jamie Cook Okay, So there's potential for that in 2022?"
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Derrick Jensen I do believe there is potential for that. Yeah. We are already [Indiscernible]. It will be [Indiscernible] guidance, so we'll see how it starts perform. But yeah, I think in the range of the guidance you'll could see that. As far as the electric power segment, I think when we put stronghold in -- when we put stronghold in, I mean, we see a double-digit margin Company. And as we look at it going forward, we believe that the segment will perform in those areas. Obviously, as we go into '22 we will be prudent about how we guide as we always are. We've got to get through whether we have a lot of [Indiscernible] performing in the field. And I think in general when we think about it, the business is healthy. It's in a good secular macro-environment. We really like where we sit. We think we're doing  things collaboratively. And anything that Blattner has is added to us. And again, their culture and what we're doing internally as far as melting together and looking for opportunity, I can only say that I feel stronger about it today than I did October 3rd."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jamie Cook But, I guess my question is, do you see longer-term in upward bias? Is it more profit dollar growth versus margin? Is  that the way to think about it?"
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Marc Bianchi Hey, . I wanted to talk about the acquired businesses and what's implied for fourth quarter and try to understand that in the context of the Blattner guidance for '21, or '22 excuse me. I think if I take this fourth quarter revenue from the acquired businesses, it's like a run rate of $1.8 billion annually. And the Blattner guide, I think you said earlier, 2,5 to 2,7 for '22, so is there just a lot of seasonality in that business? Is there -- are  there some projects moving around or perhaps it's just conservatism? I'm curious if you could help us understand that progression a little better."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Derrick Jensen Yeah, sure. Partly, it's only a partial quarter contribution that we did not acquire the Company exactly at the quarter, so there's only a part of October, so that's a component of it. Two, exactly. It's unfair to annualize a given quarter much like it is on Quanta. We have a degree of seasonality. You can't take any given quarter and annualize that. There are movements of projects and seasonality. That is still yet the case as well for Blattner and any of the companies that we acquire. We still yet feel very comfortable with the 2.5-2.7 original guidance for Blattner irrespective of this quarter contribution. And then lastly, there is a bit of just [Indiscernible] at starts and stops of projects, affecting the number. And then probably the last point that you raised is that we have been trying to be a bit prudent with the contribution because of the fact that we have, just outflows the transaction, we got opening balance sheet work to do. Looking at how some of that opening balance sheet will play out to the rest of those contracts. So 4 or 5 different factors there, but net-net, we feel very comfortable still with 2,5-2,7 annual '22 contribution."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Marc Bianchi Okay. Super,  for that. Maybe looking longer-term, Duke, you mentioned CO_2 and hydrogen pipeline opportunity work down the road. How big could that business be for you, maybe on a on a percentage of what you do today or maybe what the dollar addressable market might look like, and how does that differ from the work you do today on a maybe per mile basis or however you want to talk about it, is it much larger in terms of total dollars per mile a pipeline or what ever the scope of the work is?"
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Duke Austin No, I don't think so. When we look at it, we're really just thinking about it. It's part of the segment and much like you would think about LNG when you're moving LNG or you're doing things. Really what you're seeing is the transition of infrastructure, where our role is in this infrastructure transition as we move into the future. I mean, I think we just sit right in the middle of it on anything you can think about is that transition. Whether they need -- they're going to need pipe to move it and they're also going to need pipe to move hydrogen and into blend into natural gas, and I think when you start blending that, you have different infrastructure. So all these different things that we're bringing into the markets: batteries, EV, renewables, technology with 5G, all those things are certainly where we sit. And as we sit in the nucleus of that and we think about it, as we think about Blattner and where they sit in all this, that transition is something that Quanta is really focused on from a labor standpoint, a technology standpoint, and how we help and collaborate with the client, not only from where they're at today, but how they transition. So at the very front end of that is where we're playing and it's early in hydrogen, I do think there's going to be a significant amount of opportunity going forward. But we're already seeing where turbines in power plants on gas are starting to blend and even spec, hydrogen to some degree. So it's going to be a piece of the nucleus of how you regulate and keep the grid balanced. The bigger issue with the grid is to balance it. Signed, when, and then the balance thereof so hydrogen will play a part in it."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Noelle Dilts I wanted to just -- . I just wanted to touch on, from a very high level maybe, how we should think about the timing or cadence of work in 2022. I have 2 questions related to that. The first is, if higher steel or raw material costs are impacting timing at all, are you seeing any projects really pushed to the right? And then second, if you could touch on how we should think about Blattner typical seasonality, would be helpful. ."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Duke Austin I would say our commentary on Blattner on the numbers that we've given you based upon us and whether we are going into next year or not. [Indiscernible] any supply chain issue, we are highly confident in those numbers."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Noelle Dilts Okay, . That's really helpful. And then second, I just wanted to clarify one point, within underground utility and infrastructure. On the LDC business, I know you said you're still seeing strong demand there. When you mentioned the COVID impact to margins, was that mostly a strong hold or did you also see that at any LDC business? And if you could comment on where margins are running today or this year versus where you expect them to be over the next couple of years. ."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Duke Austin Yeah. No, I would say to our Canadian operations, I think were probably the most affected with COVID, certainly. And when we look at it, we look at it going forward and we've started some nice projects up there and I think we're in from a good shape on the GAAP side. And as far as on the electric side, we had commentary around that and obviously we've got -- the health and safety of these employees are what we're really focused on, to make sure they're safe every day and we've given them  mitigation and  plans to be safe. We've done that through the Company and have not missed work yet for two years. And I fully expect us to operate right through it and we're going to work with our client on any mandate there may be in geographically or holistically."

As we integrate Blattner, not the case, short-term, and I know that's a big part of your DNA and what Quanta does really, really well. But just curious on your thoughts on the merits versus risks of investing more pro-cyclically, now that things are hotter, evaluations are probably hotter, maybe there's more embedded backlog risk and targets you might acquire. So just your thoughts on what the go-forward cadence m ight look like for additional acquisitions. ."

I'm talking more from the T&D side on hardening resilience relative to new investment replacement. Is that shifting? Are they focusing more on the former? And I'm assuming there is not a major difference in margin or utilization depending on what you guys do for them, but just wanted to -- if you could share your thoughts on that."

I guess my question and  for all the questions you've answered. But, on Blattner, just the award activity in 3Q and since. Given that you talked about a lot of solar mix shift for next year relative to the wind projects, I guess, maybe just an update on how things are trending there. And if that mix shift is coming through, and then also it seems like there's been a lot  of approvals for offshore wind projects, and I think that's outside of the house that you're looking at. But are there opportunities for you to participate on any of those?"

It sounds like there's a learning curve on Telecom that you're experiencing now and I want to make sure we understand how to set our expectations on that from here as it relates to the margins. What are the different elements of the learning curves you have to get up? And when can we expect that to normalize such that we can have a more consistent margin expectation here on the Telecom side within that -- the electric segment. And just maybe a quick follow-up on -- just to clarify, on the Blattner deal, you've been extremely clear about the confidence that you have in the guidance numbers, but you've talked about the revenue numbers, not the EBITDA contribution. I just want to make sure there's no difference in your confidence in -- between the revenue and EBITDA. ."
4465584,"Quanta Services, Inc.",PWR,11/4/2021,CEO Duke Austin on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Duke Austin Double-digit EBITDA on Blattner. As far as the Telecom, we've talked about it in length. I think, in general, what I would say is, the closeouts in the end, as far as engineering closeouts and things like that, and then some descoping us serve clients on their builds, created some effects in projects, We're still working with the client. We will do our best to claw stuff back. But if you think about it, if we get $200 million and we did 6% instead of 10%, it's $6 million, something like that. It's just -- it's not big numbers for us long-term and I think we're not seeing big effects to that as far as margins and we will get them in the double-digit ranges. We're operating for primarily in those ranges. We had some projects early on that are complicated and it's an Industry issue. It's not just us, so it's something that we're all faced with and some closeouts. And I think we're in the late stages of those closeouts and you'll start to see it get back into double-digits. . We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments. First, I really want to welcome the people of Blattner and certainly the culture there and then the people in the field, the people that pay our pay checks. Thank them for what they do every day. And storms were tough. Our people perform extremely well through the tough environment down in the Gulf Coast and certainly the families lost lives and [Indiscernible] to there, it's tough.

You - Peter, you said the normalized gross margin, you can now commit to north of 26.5.

Some limitations in that right now, just given the supply chains and availability of the wrong funds further up the supply chain and in greenfield along the line in greenfield, we know there are markets around the country that's been adopting this type of solution, this value-added solution, very, very quickly and we see tremendous opportunities in expanding our footprint, being the provider of choice and the provider with the best sort of variable cost position as we execute that as well to be successful long term."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Dahl And my second question, obviously the scale, the execution, the way you positioned the business has helped you to capture a decent amount of share in a very dynamic and supply constrained environment and it's demonstrated the potential power and profitability of the business. As you look forward, there is probably a world in which when things normalize, some of your maybe smaller mom and pop competitors are, get back on their feet an d I guess the question is really, when you think about customer stickiness and share the stickiness in share gains, how does your experience this year affect how you think about balancing share versus price and margin in a more normal environment and maybe if that differs when you think about commodity versus value add."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman Yes, just from a modeling perspective, I think, how that manifests itself is a little bit of having both. There will be quarters when certainly the mom and pops will level things out in certain of the more commoditized product areas. Our commitment is to just to be the organization that wins at the end of the day, we think we can continue to perform better than market. We think our mix of products allows us to execute that achievement at a higher than higher than industry margin because of our ability to pull through that value-added mix, do it very efficiently and to manage the combined entity in a way to really leverage scale and drive through those investments in technology and leadership in ways that others can't touch. So certainly think it will continue to be competitive, what they said that doesn't change and there'll be some ebbs and flows and that never moves in a straight line, but we think that base business trend over time it's going to be - is going to be very desirable to all involved."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Dahl Okay, , well , both. I appreciate that and look forward to the Investor Day."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ketan Mamtora  and let me offer my congratulations as well. A really strong performance. Within manufactured products. I'm just curious, are there any specific product categories that you are seeing kind of stronger growth versus the others and that these labor challenges are kind of driving faster adoption of component offsite manufacturing."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman Yeah, I think - the  news is we're seeing strength in all categories of our manufacturing components, whether it's a roof truss systems or floor systems, it has been well publicized. EWP has been a challenging supply environment this year through the  work of our - teams. All around the country we've been able to get the volumes that we needed, although it's been a price, and they remains there. But importantly also our Ready Frame is up over 30% this year on a year-to-date basis in-house count. So we're not really seeing any areas of weakness. And really the system approach that we're taking the structural design helps support all pieces of our manufactured components business. So we're excited about we're getting big traction everywhere."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ketan Mamtora And then my other question with other base business steadily moving higher, I'm just curious kind of how do you think, or is there any rethink in how you - how you look at the leverage on the Company."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Reuben Garner . , everybody and congrats on the results. So can you just talk about, I mean the big businesses. I'm looking at it correctly, going to be up over 25% revenue this year. Profit is going to be growing north of 60%. What kind of gives you the confidence that you'll be able to grow. I think you made the comment that you think you can grow the base business next year. Can you just talk about what you're seeing that gives you that level of comfort."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Jackson Sure. Well, a couple of things, first of all, I just want to be very clear. The strategy of the company is predicated on the base business and are always has been. So the fact that we've broken that out has provides an external clarity, but this is what we're trying to drive. Right. Our organic growth or value added portions of the business is at the heart of what we're trying to do and so I'm not surprised by it. And given the demand environment that we're seeing, we expect that will continue, but al so in the areas of the value add that we're focused on, we have been for quite some time now taking market share and we do expect that will continue for a long time to come. So I just want to be clear though, this is the focus of the companies, with the leadership team is a breeze every day and that's what we're driving into the marketplace with our customers."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Reuben Garner So, in an environment where maybe the starts single family or total DARTs are flat next year. Do you think that you still, with the backlog in the business that you have and the initiatives you have to grow the value add to be able to grow the business in that environment?"
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman Yes, absolutely. And we do think, it's been well publicized here starts of slowed through the third quarter of this year but, but to a customer, every one of them point to supply chain challenges not weakening underlying demand. So there has been a little pause on stores and we saw that through the third quarter and you just see in our results. So that gives me even more confidence that we're going to be able to sustain our performance even in a weaker starts environment. These products are very sticky even if start slow, that the labor challenges are going away, the things we're delivering value on for our customers are not going to change for our value proposition is robust and strong in any stores environment."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Reuben Garner Okay. And then last one for me. Are there any areas, most companies that have reported third-quarter results so far ran into some kind of supply chain issues and had volume even volume pressure in some cases. Are there any areas of your business that you're having product shortages or where there is bottleneck that you didn't see growth that's been pushed out to future quarters or if you guys have been able to overcome this somehow with your scale and reach."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Keith Hughes Just getting back to the availability questions that we've had before. Are you seeing, if you could call it major product galleries, were you seeing things actually getting better sequentially or is the situation just not improved in the last 3 to 4 months."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman Yeah, I would say Keith it's incrementally better, certainly on the commodity side of the business as I mentioned. That is loosened up a bit. Interior doors are better than they were a quarter ago. We're still struggling with exterior doors. Hardware remains a challenge, moldings remainder challenge. A lot of the specialty products are a real challenge. Windows remains in high demand and with - backlogs. Our team is working on that challenge. It has been for a long time. This is - the encouraging part of it is, even though our millwork, doors and windows organic growth was lower than our total or lower than our total for single-family, we have seen sequentially each quarter of this year that continue to improve. Right. We were at 19% this quarter versus single family of 27.5%, but we were 15-ish in Q2. So I think that just speaks to over to softening, but more importan tly, the  work that our team continues to do every day to get us what we need."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Keith Hughes And final question. Comments from your builder customer, you talked about some of the slowdown they've, many of them have talked about. As I talk to you about next year are they expecting average pacing of completions during the year, more front loaded any sort of color you can give on that would be helpful."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman Yeah, it's still early and we are in those conversations. But obviously we're kicking stars out of this year. We'll certainly many good things for the first half, at least the next year. The other piece of it, which we heard a little bit about is land and development of that and I think this gives them a chance to catch the breath, a little bit and get out in front of that a little bit, where I think they were may be caught off guard a bit with the strength of the start this year. But what we're hearing, by and large is continued strength and continued high demand for what we offer them. We'll move next to David Manthey of Baird. Your line is open."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,David Manthey David mentioned Ready Frame and I was wondering if you could talk about what percentage of revenues that is today and what was the comparable figure in the third quarter of 2019. You also gave us an interesting stat there. You said that house count was up 30% year-over-year. Could you provide that number from the Third quarter of 2019 as well. Sorry for all the data request here.
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman Yeah, I know and we may have cash you offline on all that. I don't have all that in my fingertips at the moment Dave but just suffice as to say that we're quite pleased with the penetration that we continue to get and we've put to actually even in the BMC days we've put into looking at this more at a house account level to understand. It's more but organic growth of the business, how are we penetrating the market more. So that's really not a new metric for us and it takes out the noise around what's going on with the commodities in the revenues up and down and we were focused squarely in-house account penetration, as I said, that's up 40% over 30% this year and as you recall, last year was pretty strong. So we're excited about it. It is mirroring very much what's going on with our manufactured products in general and we expect that growth will continue."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Manthey Okay, . Yeah, I'll look forward to catching up with you on that. And my second question is on the software acquisitions. Could you describe how Apollo and Para kind of fit together and are there additional modules or capabilities that you're going to need to complete your tech platform or is this sort of a complete suite of software now."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman We're very pleased with Paradigm and that is the broad capability - start the digital platform, right, and the configuration capabilities they have. That they comply almost exclusively to the newer portion of business. As I've said previously, we're excited to be able to take that on the prior categories and expand it more broadly. Apollo was a unique one and that was very opportunistic. If you saw that the - we got a really good deal on that. And it provides particularly mobile capability and some of the fast end works that the Paradigm - provide and take orders chance like management capability. And so we're excited about the end-to-end solution that we have now and if all pick up just say the development were from the back end. And we'll move next to those light to the site of Steven Ramsey. Your line is open."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steven Ramsey Maybe to start with the synergies, can you clarify the new synergies are updated synergies, as you say, does that include any of the acquisitions that have been made. If I think about distributor acquisitions, the sales total over $600 million of. So it seems like there would be some meaningful synergies coming in."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman Yeah. So it does not. Those are still - hose are limited to the DMC merger synergies. So midpoint of 100 on the P&L for '21 and mid-point of our run rate for what 150 by 2022. That does not include the tailwinds from the smaller entities not tracking in the same way. I don't think it's particularly helpful to report it in that consolidated way. It is showing up in the materials for the profitability obviously in that organic growth number. So probably we won't be breaking that out separately, but certainly we'll continue to talk about excellence metrics and where we can identify significant projects."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steven Ramsey Okay, helpful. And then if I'm looking at this correctly, it appears the incremental margins on the base business in FY '20 and FY '21 guide or in the low 20% range above normal, is that expected to moderate as the environment in demand trends normalize over the next year, two years."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Michael Neese Leo, let's - we'll move to the next analyst please. We will. We'll move next to Kurt Yinger of DA Davidson. Your line is open."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kurt Yinger ,  and  Dave and Peter Just on the base business. EBITDA increased to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion previously. Kind of curious what the moving pieces are there. Maybe it just goes back to kind of the last point around pricing discipline and whatnot, but it seems like a pretty nice uplift, considering the volume outlook and what is unchanged here. And then as we think about kind of building out 2022 kind of how confident are you in using that as kind of a good jumping-off point."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Jackson Yes. So the work in pricing. As you know, Kurt is something we've been focused on for a few years and putting these two teams together lett ing really high quality leadership to engage with that yield, working together, sharing best practices, that really has moved, we think, the baseline. I think that's certainly there were some examples of situations where we found ourselves in possession of product outline cost in terms of current pricing and not going to apologize for that. But certainly our ability to continue to be disciplined helped us in the quarter and will help us on an ongoing basis and that is the result of that historical investment, that alignment, the way we think about pricing, the tools we put in place, the way we train. All of that has come to fruition, particularly as you look at the business, this combined wealth, has a  market position and in markets around the country where there is just tremendous demand and growth, we're really well positioned."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kurt Yinger And then second, just as I think about the products you sell from a pricing perspective. Commodities, likely to be a headwind here over the next couple of quarters but you name it EWP, windows, siding doors, there is a pretty significant level of underlying price inflation out there. So can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about that impact on the top line here going forward and how it might help offset that drag from lumber and panels."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Jackson Well, you're right, there is tremendous inflation in the marketplace. Like you said a number of different products, we are very focused on making sure we're passing that through. Some of the leverage you see from that is part of what is driving some of those margins, obviously. It doesn't cost any more to transport a more expensive piece of lumber window or door. It is probably a smaller component, but certainly important to mention. As we continue to see volatility in prices, we are going to maintain our discipline around passing it through. There will be instances where things will go back down and we all but adapt to that and make sure that you are still the provider of choice, that we're providing tremendous value to our customers, that are our products or relationships with vendors are served to move through, that the high volumes that our - that our vendors want to see to meet the demand that their customers want to receive but that dynamic, that ability to continue to be consistently disciplined, it is something we pride ourselves in and that's something I think we've proven the capability to do even in really unprecedented, we call it times. And we'll move next to Jay McCanless of Wedbush. Your line is open."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jay McCanless Hi, . , everyone.  quarter both. So another question on Slide 16. It looks like the EBITDA ranges at all the dollar per MBF. All the EBITDA range has moved up. I guess: A, is that right, and then B, what's the biggest driver here is? is it a change in mix, some of the acquisitions. Just any - which one of these assumptions on the right hand side of the slide, which was the biggest driver on that."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Jackson Yeah, no, The catch. So it doesn't move right when the base business on the prior slide bumps up, which we did increase the guide there. It reflects in that, that sensitivity on Slide 16 about what this business might look like at different commodity prices. It's a couple of factors. I - obviously with the growth of the value add faster than the four, you continue to see that favorable performance on an ongoing basis in what we consider base right that normalized margin level as a powerful influence on this. Our ability to manage price in see sustained margins across the portfolio and in the way we do things is certainly reflected in here. As this discipline around expenses, the improved performance and synergies, the operational excellence initiatives we're seeing in there are bearing fruit. All of that is in some way, contributing to the increased sort of starting point and as reflected on the sensitivity."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jay McCanless , . And then my second question, I guess, staying on the slide, where, where did in the way you are calculating this blended. I think it's a blend of both framing lumber and sheet lumber. Where did this dollar per MBS in within the third quarter."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Jackson Yeah. So you're hitting a point that's always a challenge right it is. We don't know where commodities are going to go, it was certainly a bit of a surprise for us in terms of the guide in the back half of the year. It has absolutely leveled out above the $400 levels. It is going up, I mean branded alliances between 500 and 600 if you're talking about kind of lumber and sheet in terms of what we're seeing. We'll see where it goes from here. But on a year-over-year basis as Kurt mentioned earlier, there is certainly a turn in terms of the year-over-year comparisons, but still very, v ery strong and healthy from our - from a historical perspective. But at the end of the day, we're still going to circle back to base business and we're going to focus on running the quarter. We'll reap the benefits of commodities, but that's not where our attention is going to stay."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jay McCanless All right. And one other - one if I could sneak it in. Do you feel like from a pricing power perspective during the third quarter, did you get - were you able to take more price on the value-add goods or were you able to hold the line better on commodity goods even as the underlying commodity went down in price."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman Yes. So I mean it is - price is a small part of what we do now, it's certainly shrunk in recent years. The vast majority of what we're selling in the commodity space is quoted in pass-through in a pretty narrow period of time. We're pretty happy with that balance. The amount of inventory we have on hand and on order with the way we're quoting but we can walk through that in more detail for you offline. If you look at the end of the day with commodities important part of what we do, we think of our more important part is certainly the base business and what we're doing with the overall strategy."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Iman Akram Okay, . And yes, it will be helpful. If we could talk offline at some point."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Gilbert And my first question. . And I want to talk about, or I should say Peter you've talked in the past about the backup in units authorized but not started. And that's certainly something that we're seeing in the data and Dave, it sounds like based on your comments earlier builders are certainly planning for more units going ahead. I'm just wondering if you're, if you're seeing so far in the fourth quarter, some movement on getting those units started. Maybe a re-acceleration and starts or if we think that's more a 2022 story."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman And we also know that they are squarely focused on winning completions between by the end of the year. And so, my earlier comment, I do think the stars growth will still and in the first half of next year quite nicely."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Gilbert Second question is on multifamily just parsing the guide, it looks like we should expect a big year-over-year increase in - in multifamily in the fourth quarter and am I thinking about that correctly? And how does the pipeline or the backlog of multifamily projects look as you sit today."
4465655,"Builders FirstSource, Inc.",BLDR,11/4/2021,CEO Dave Flitman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Flitman Yes. No. . So there is multi-families of venture and we like to be able to reference it as a comparison, the National Multifamily number but still it is not a comparable metric for us given we're really sort of focused on our few key regions around the country. A lot of movement within those, within the market is project driven. - the sort of lumpy moves in and out in any given period. I don't know that I agree that it's a large expected increase for the fourth quarter. I think we're still positive, I think that the one adjustment that I will highlight is we did dispose of our standalone gypsum business that did have some multifamily and commercial exposure fuel feel a little bit of moves in that in the R&R another bucket but it is pretty modest overall. It's a good area for us. We are seeing growth and we think that will continue through the fourth quarter and into next year. And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I'd be happy to return the call to Michael Neese for any concl uding remarks.  for your time today and for your interest in Builders FirstSource as Dave mentioned, we are hosting an Investor Day on December 7th in the Dallas area. We look forward to hosting you in person or virtually through webcast, if you'd like to attend in person, please email me at michael.neese@bldr.com. Have a  day. . This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a  day."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams , Mig. I appreciate you picked up on that comment during on the -- toward my opening comments. But yes. So what I would characterize, these are secular trends that feel longer than a normal business cycle. This is going to take decades to unfold electrification or living kind of a subset of that. And digitization continues to just transform out. We interface with each other and how we interface with the supply chain. So these are things that I view as being bigger, longer than a typical business cycle. For us, it's going to be a combination of infrastructure. So the infrastructure goes around the world to put these in place, things that are also onboard equipment in both of these are bill of material plus type of additions for us. And then also the fact that they should be faster-growing environments as a result of. We are doing innovation in this space but a lot of our portfolio today, which is what I mentioned on that one slide, 2/3 of today is already clean technology-related. Yes, we're adding some motors and motor controllers and software in addition to our current portfolio. But our current portfolio was already designed to be very energy source [Indiscernible] and be able to respond to these changing dynamics. We will try to give a little more context of this in Investor Day. But we just started before the call to try to last couple of days, quantify digital and the threat that it cuts to the Company and it's surprisingly large. And we'll give you more context on that with some actual numbers when we get to Investor Day, but, it has an opportunity you with -- you think of the Company is being very diverse. And probably no end markets outside of Aerospace being bigger than 5 or 6% digitals are threat to Custer, so many, it's going to be probably second to Aerospace, the biggest spread the Custer the Company. And ESG's unfolding for the next 20-30 years, as the world tries to get to carbon neutrality. So that's what I like if you've got a prior environment thinking on Liza by watch, 7 years to industrial recessions in a pandemic. I think we're facing a much more constructive environment going forward."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mircea Dobre Understood. Then my follow-up is on international, which frankly performed quite a bit better than, I guess. Two questions here. One is on the margin side, in terms of Incrementals and maybe some things that might have been unique that helped the quarter. I don't know if there's anything to call that. And on the order front, I'm curious as to how you're seeing the various regions develop, China in particular. I know that geography punches maybe above its weight from a profitability and margin standpoint. So what are you seeing there and what's the impact on a go-forward basis in terms of mix? ."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams So maybe I'll start with that Mig first. It's Tom again. On the orders, they were strong throughout the quarter and to help people, it's easier to look at it from a dollar value basis. It's dollar value was fairly consistent with what we saw on a prior quarters. We had nice consistency. The numbers in the 26% improvement went down from where we were in the mid 50s just because the prior period was improving. But we saw all regions strong internationally, all 3 of the national regions were pretty much the same. We reported our national as 25, but all 3 regions underneath there were pretty much plus or minus 25, give or take some change. On the margin side, I would say there was nothing in particular that is different other than what we've been doing all along which was when Strategy at 2.0 and 3.0 and a rapid resizing of the Company post-pandemic and then being very careful as we move into a higher demand of feathering costs and a very judicious type of fashion And a much more lean and natural fashion we've had ever before because our cost structure is so much better. I do think international has less supply chain disruptions than North America for sure, and you see that reflected in MROS."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Sprague .  for that. That's very interesting. And then on price costs, it is quite an achievement that not only get the dollar neutrality, but margin rate neutrality, but I wonder if you could just give us a ballpark number of the actual realized price on a year-over-year basis that you're running at. Your nominal price."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Banks Jeff, it's Lee. I can't give you an actual number, but I will tell you the margin neutrality is a lot of hard work by everybody in the Company. And I think it shouldn't be a surprise. We've had two processes embedded in our wind strategy for going on 20 years, and that's around pricing and it's around supply chain. And those processes give us very accurate indices around our selling price index and our purchase price index. So what it does, it aligns the whole Company and it gives us a way to roll things up about what we need to do going forward. And what you're seeing or the benefits of those processes really embedded in the Company and institutionalized."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Davis Well,  results from you guys make our lives a little easier. So  for that. Now that we've had a little bit of time, not post - COVID yet, but a little bit of time. Can we take stock of [Indiscernible] and exotic kind of where they are at versus the deal models on, imagine, perhaps maybe not quite on the top-line, that your deal model, but perhaps better on the margin line, but I'm just guessing. Some color there would be helpful."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams Yes, Scott, it's Tom. We cannot be happier with both of these transactions. LORD has proven to be more resilient and faster growing than legacy Parker, and that's what we had hoped for. Its margins are beating what we had expected in -- at this kind of cash flow that we've reviewed with the board. It's performing in the upper 20s EBITDA, so it's accretive on growth, it's accretive on margins, accretive on cash flow, and is exposed to more longer cycle businesses. Then Exotic has performed remarkably well. Remember, when we bought Exotic, nobody would've anticipated the 737 MAX being grounded for as long as it was. And even with that strength of their portfolio than the team, we've put up mid-20s EBITDA. So it's a little light on the top-line, mainly because of 2 things that match grounding and the pandemic. But its margins have held up very consistent to what we had approved for the port and we know we're at the beginning of a long cycle improvement there with Exotic. The aerospace traffic is going to come back and the max ramp up is coming back. So we've gotten through the worst of it and it's going to be quite an exciting transaction for us."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Banks Just hey, I referred CLARCOR. It's been obviously a few years, but that business is also exceeding our expectations from the model standpoint. So a lot of hard work across the team. And that is flowing through in all those numbers that we just talked about. They're a big piece of that as well. So, didn't want to lose sight of that."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Davis That was a  deal, but moving on. I love your Slide 6 of the semiconductor example, but how do you -- can you go to market as one [Indiscernible] when you're looking at content into a semi fab?"
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams We do Scott, we have account managers that cover certain accounts and they're representing and looking at the entire business and that's how -- we're so organized operationally around technologies. But our commercial teams are organized around channels to market, either global OEMs, national OEMs, or distribution. And so it's that accoun t management team that brings power -- power of Parker to their customers. Or if we go through our channel partners, these are our distributors. They are bringing the power of Parker and bringing that comprehensive offering together."

4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ann Duignan Hi, . Ann Duignan here after 20 years."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ann Duignan Maybe first on your guidance for our fiscal Q2, you're guiding to 374 at the midpoint and consensus is that 386. Can you talk about where you think the biggest disconnect is between our sell-side models and what you're guiding to? Where should we be most focused and where do we need to review?"
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams At this time, I would say it's probably at the top line. So what we tried to do with Q2, you saw that we raised the organic look full-year from 7% to 8.5%, and that was primarily by raising the second half. Our second half in a prior guide was 4.5% and a new guide is 6%. We left Q2, basically the same. And that's really based on what we saw in Q1 and in particular in October, around just supply chain challenges, more around what I was talking about with Jeff, around our customer demand and kind of the uncertainties or difficulty in predicting, delivery dates of time on this. On that, you also have -- you just look at the raw dollars, the dollars flow very much proportionally from Q1 to Q2. So normally in Q2, we would have less work days, which was what we have. In North America typically if you look is over the last 20 years. Our Q2 is typically a 4% lighter Q1 and their national typically 1% lighter. We lowered North America air more minus 5 from a dollar standpoint versus Q1, mainly because that extra 100 bps of some supply chain uncertainties. And part of what we're looking at is those temporary idling that customers have been doing. And in particular, we haven't had any customers announced yet. You've got the holidays and it would be very easy for them just to extend a day or 1/2 day, those types of things. And so we're just trying to be pragmatic as to what Q2 would look like given the natural progression for Q1 and Q2, putting on a little bit of price changes. And so I think the difference would be on the top line because the incrementals for Q2, if you look at it on an apples-to-apples. again, taking out the discretionary basis that we had in prior Q2, it's another upper 50s, just like Q1. So when you look at the operational excellence, upper 50s incrementals is pretty hard to beat. And so really the only difference you could have is top-line assumptions. I'm giving you the context of how we came up with our Q2."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ann Duignan Very helpful in there. I guess if I had time to back into all your first half -- back half I would have figured that out. So I appreciate you taking the time to give us that color. Just as a follow-up then. If I look at your sales in diversified industrial North America up 19% versus orders up 32%, which suggests that your lead times are extending. A, can you just confirm that. And B, is that what gives you confidence in the back half revenues or is there still some uncertainty when you're not known for having long lead times. So they have confidence in the back-half and make no change to your revenue outlook for half too. Is some of that back-half contingent on all of these supply chains getting better through the course of Q2 and off to the races thereafter or is there still some lack of visibility [Indiscernible] -- per back-half for you guys. And I'll leave it there, ."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams And it's Tom, again. So yes, we don't always have complete visibility, but our backlog is increasing sequentially. North America, went up 14% and international went up 6%. So that's part of it. We're also just recognizing that the second half, we don't see -- significant improvement from supply chain. We think you'll get a little bit of most of those supply chain improvements will be more so into our FY '23. We have not been impacted a lot of that, but I think the difference you're seeing between orders and organic growth is what I was referring to earlier as customers putting in orders and having it be over multi-quarters release dates, whereas in the past they would give us orders that were much shorter cycle. These are longer cycle by industrial standards with release dates over multiple quarters."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Ann Duignan Okay. That's helpful color. I appreciate that. . I'll get back in queue.
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Raso Hi, . Obviously been covering the Company for some years and the international margins have really been impressive now running ahead of North America. And part of it lately maybe it's been a supply-chain  issues are a little more acute in North America. But can you help us better understand how we should think about that notable improvement international margins, be it geographic, be it obviously building out more Parker stores, whatever it maybe, bigger distribution there. Just trying to understand. So when we think about -- if you say the upcoming March meeting and we think about margin improvement from here. It just was a major issue year s ago about can International get close or equal North America. And now it's been many quarters in a row it's running ahead. And I'm just curious about the drivers and how to think about that going forward. ."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams Good, David, it's Tom, we could not be happier obviously, because it has been sort of companies been working on for a long time on international margins. So I would say it's started a while even before the changes still wind strategy. At least in my watch, it started with our team working very hard to change the cost structure in all international, in particular in EMEA. And just recognizing that all those different countries and different infrastructures, there was an opportunity to try to simplify that. So that's been going on for multiple years, having a more agile lower cost structure than a concerted effort to grow international distribution from where we started at 35% -- at 35-65% split. Now to 40 and we'll give you the latest when we get to Investor Day, but it's north of 40 now, so you getting some mix help there. We've had -- Asia is always historically been a very strong performer. We really kind of set that region up that we think you can think about over the last 30 years, we set that region up. The latest and so we took all the best practices that we had from everywhere around the world when we set that region up from a cost structure standpoint. But what's helped us a lot the last couple of years is the Europe team and Latin America being small for us, but both of those teams have made a marked improvement. And when we think going forward your other part of your question, David, we see no reason why they can't continue. We'll give you new targets when we get to March. But you see right now our full-year guide. basically North America international margins conversion. We had always hoped that they be basically the same. And so going forward, we don't see any reason why they can't be and they both have equal opportunity to grow to higher levels and we'll give you that vision in March."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Raso A quick follow-up. The back-half for the year fiscally speaking, if revenue is only up 4% and I have to believe pricing is running probably at least that. So the idea of volume being essentially flat or down in the back-half of the year. Is that simply a conservatism around the supply chain or just trying to understand why volumes want to be able to grow in the back half."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams As so just for clarification, the back half organic is 6%. You have about 1% currency headwind. So probably net's to around 5. And there is some -- we're being, what I mentioned earlier, pragmatic about the uncertainties on supply chain or so on our customers. But then we're not immune. We have some of our own challenges. But I think our team has done a particular job weathering it. And probably the best evidence of our ability to weather supply chain is just our ability at the MROS, because if you're struggling with your supply chain initiative, will it ultimately shows up in your marginal return on sales but that's how I'd characterize the second half."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nathan Jones Parker has, over the years, continued to move towards and has always maintained a local for local sourcing and manufacturing structure. Has that given you guys better supply chain here that's allowed you to pick up any market share versus competitors who might have longer supply chains? And do you think that that market share gain will be sticky or trendy when supply chains normalize?"
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lee Banks Yeah, Nathan, it's Lee. Just -- maybe I'll touch the first part. You're right. Our strategy always has been to build and source local, which has been incredibly helpful. And I think the other thing that's benefited us through these disruptions, we worked hard on dual-sourcing strategy where appropriate, which has given us some flexibility. And one of the things it -- is weaved itself into this are simple by design efforts and some key areas where it's been easier for us to do material substitutions than we've done in the past. So all that together is really, I'm not saying we're immune, but has made us to be able to work through the supply chain disruptions. I would say the market share that we pick up is very sticky. 1. You're talking about a lot of engineered products. So I mean, when people take the effort to engineer the product, and it's not something that you quickly change, 2. The reality is if we're taking on new business, we're looking for commitments both -- from both of us to be committed to the volume going forward. And to that's standpoint, I think it's sticky."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nathan Jones . And my follow-up, Tom, was to one of your comments where you talked about customers giving you I guess, orders over multiple quarters, rather than maybe orders over just one quarter. Did that have a meaningful impact on the order rates in the quarter you've just reported first-quarter '22. And should we expect that to have maybe a little bit of a negative impact on the or der rates as we go forward with that increased visibility that customers are giving you at the moment or is it not a significant amount?"
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams This is Thomas. Hard to quantify if you take the orders and try to some how dissect and separate all of the ones that are multi-quarters, I'd be hazard and just a guess, I don' t think it's material. It just -- it's different as far as in the past, at least on industrial and normal business conditions, say normal supply chains and normal order entry patterns, you had a fairly consistent input-output, quarter-to-quarter, maybe a little bit going into the next quarter. This is clearly more over multi-quarters. And actually it's good, it's customers trying to plan for longer, trying to make sure they get their ticket in line, and in a way that help us from a plans point. So when things do stabilize if they continue that way, I think that's a good thing for scheduling our factors and scheduling our supply chain."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nigel Coe . . . So Aerospace. I wanted to -- maybe unpack the our performance a little bit and maybe focus a little bit more on a military because that's been an area where we've seen, especially in the U.S. market, some noise from some of your competitors in defense. And I'm just curious how you see military over the next fiscal year compared to previous [Indiscernible]"
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams Nigel it's Tom. So on military OEMs, and that's one we mentioned in the last call, we do see that being slightly solved mid-single-digit's decline. And that's primarily because of the repositioning that our customers thankfully did to try to strengthen the supply chain and protect the supply-chain during the pandemic. They didn't want people to go wonder. And so they kind of pull forward demand into last fiscal year, leaving this fiscal year lighter. As you're adjusting inventory. So that should come back into FY '23 and beyond. And I would see that being a lower to mid-single bit. Probably more towards a low-single-digit growth on the military OE side. And then our military MRO, we had some softness in the quarter. We're still forecasting mid-single-digits positive for the full-year. Some -- the only weakness that we're really experiencing for the full-year would be the military OEM based on this supply chain, things I'd mentioned."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nigel Coe Okay. That's . , Tom. And then you raised your margin by a points at the midpoint of Aerospace. I think the revenue numbers stayed unchanged. So just curious, what's changed since you gave guidance back in August."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams The Aerospace team has done a fantastic job. There's a couple of factors, Nigel it's Tom again. First of all, a nice commercial MRO uptake. So Todd mentioned that commercial MRO up 33% for the quarter and order entry on a 312 was over 70%. So you're starting to see that replenishment of commercial aftermarket, which is up the 4 elements, the highest margin than, than we would have. And then within that kind of favorable mix of that, within that favorable mix, the spare to repair mix was favorable. So at the beginning that was just typical when customers were trying to maintain assets and minimize costs, they'll do more repair work. And then once that's exhausted and they have to put back in spares. So we've seen an uptake in spare activity. And then the aerospace team has done a  job. If you go back to the beginning of pandemic, we moved very aggressively at the beginning to resize the business for the long cycle. And what's really remarkable here is we're going to put up -- these margins were putting up the guide at 20.9% will be higher than our previous all-time high pre - COVID. And so this business is not even that 80% volume of COVID. And it's putting up margins that are higher than the best we've ever done pre-COVID. This is fantastic job. And to your point, Nigel, if you were to go compare that aerospace performance against other aerospace peers, I think we would do quite well with that."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nigel Coe Without [Indiscernible] to the question on whether you can get some mid-20s longer-term. But I think we'll leave that one for March. But , Tom. Good color."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Volkmann , guys.  for fitting me in here. You mentioned, Tom, some of your OE customers were sort of delaying some of their deliveries, certainly understandable. But what are you seeing in the distribution side? our inventory is also really low there. And would they -- rather be building them a little if they could."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams Absolutely, Steve, as Thomas Williams, I can let Lee Chime in if there's anything extra. Our distributors are flying the same challenges when you talk to them, they would love to be building inventory. This is what would be strategic use of cash for them as they could but they are having a hard time. All of our suppliers are getting out to where they would like them to be. So there's pretty much running hand about. And so that -- when I think about the longer-t erm opportunities for us on growth here, you've got the pent-up demand that reflects off the towards the bottom. But there will be an inventory replenishment back to normal levels for distribution, which will be -- will help us. And if you go out longer than that, you've got CapEx reinvestment. Two things there, under-investment in I think this whole localization as a giant burner underneath it now, because of this lack of product availa bility, is going to drive customers and suppliers to add capacity and to create dual capacities which has infrastructure opportunities for us, ESG, and then just the capital deployments. So I think there's long-term secular growth trajectory, but to get to your more near-term question, Yes, the distributors are in desperate need of more material, and we're doing everything that we can to get it to them."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Volkmann Okay, . And maybe just my quick follow-up. You guys obviously did much better this quarter than I think most of us expected, and I think maybe then you even expected, and yet for most of our companies, things are actually deteriorated through the quarter. So I guess I'm just curious really what changed for you from 3 months ago that allowed you to kind of come in with such a strong result?"
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams companies that are accretive on margins and cash and growth. So it's not an overnight sensation it's really you go to that one slide that shows the EBITDA trend it's been building on the pace of that improvement on top of some very quick cost actions that we did in the pandemic. And thankfully, not a lot of those costs have come back. We've been able to run the business differently in a more digital fashion, which is clearly helped us on some of those variable costs."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Hammond Appreciate you fitting me in. I know you can't say much on the mega deal, but I just wanted to understand if in Europe, from your perspective, if the review process or the gating factors around getting the deal closed or the timing has changed any -- in any way."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams Jeff, it's Tom. No, not at all. We're -- we're on schedule. We're always kind of anticipated third quarter, next calendar year. The reviews we're doing with the government on economic, and national security will conclude well before that. And then really the pacing item will be just the anti-trust and FTI filings which are proceeding as planned, but you just can't predict every country as the different process and timing. And it's difficult to project that outcome. So that's our best guess, but everything is on schedule."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Hammond Okay, . And then Tom, I like the slide on the clean tech as well, 2/3 of the product enabling clean tech. But I'm just wondering if you have a sense of what you think your revenue mix is today to clean tech or ESG markets and what you think that might look like 3 to 5 years out."
4465668,Parker-Hannifin Corp.,PH,11/4/2021,CEO Thomas Williams on Q1 Fiscal 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Thomas Williams Yeah, it's Tom again. So it's basically that 2/3 numbers. That's how we came up with it, it's 2/3. Our revenue today would be supporting clean tech. I would argue everything we do supports sustainability, even if you take, say, engine and mobile filtration that we've be doing for heavy-duty trucks is helping that fuel run more efficiently and better emissions So even today, we just try to be very conservative in that number, recognizing that that was still a fossil fuel related technology. But it's going to morph into a 100% of the portfolio because everything is -- if you take construction equipment fossil fuel moves to more electric, all you're really doing is changing the power source. You're going from say engine at [Indiscernible] and a [Indiscernible] getting engine, diesel engine, to higher Gen Energen or FuelCell or battery or some combination thereof. And all of our technologies are still needed to facilitate the work functions and the propel functions. And if anything, like I had mentioned before, our build material gets bigger because there's much more heat, and you've got a management of all of our engineering materials, technologies. We do have, I think, a bigger bill of material that we'll have -- with our motion technologies as we add more motor content and more software, etc. So we're very excited. It came back to those secular trend for us: Aerospace, ESG, electrification and digitization. I think you're going to see a different Parker if you look at for the next 5."

4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet , .  for all the detail there and just want to pick up on the MISO MTAP side. I was just wondering if you might be able provide any more color for your expectations there in the process. And what could this specifically mean for Ameren over time? Realize might begin a little bit ahead of ourselves here, but just want to know if there’s any way you could frame, I guess what you think could be possible for Ameren CapEx, yes?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Warner Baxter Yes. , Jeremy, for the question. Number one, let me just start with this. We’re very excited about the opportunity that we have for the transmission investment. Number one, we’re absolutely convinced that transmission is going to play an integral role. And that’s a fair company, for our country and really executing this clean energy transition. And we’re right in the middle of it. We have been before, and we are going to continue to be. And so look, it’s premature to put I would say, a specific number. As you heard us in our prepared remarks, MISO has identified $30 billion to $100 billion of investment opportunities of potential projects. And I will tell you, where the country is going is closer to that scenario 3, which is closer to the $100 billion number. So what we’re doing – what MISO is doing, what stakeholders are doing. Look, we’re working together to try and make sure that we put together a good set of projects coming out of this first MTAP that will start us on this path toward just clean energy transition. And as we look at it, if you look at that scenario 1 that’s highlighted out there, we really think the focus will be on more no regrets types of projects as we start putting our toes in the water, if you will, maybe getting up to our knees. And then from there, I think we’ll see it continue to get progressively bigger over time. We think there’ll be some no regrets projects. And in terms of timing, look, I think the group – our group and many stakeholders are working collaboratively to try and figure out the best projects as well as cost allocation things. These things are all things that you typically go through in this process. And so at the end of the day, we think that MISO will propose early in 2022, these projects to their Board of Directors, it will be well informed. And then what we believe will be hopefully will be an approval process that will get them in early 2022. So when you look at them in our overall plans, as we’ve said before, you might see some of these projects in our current five-year plan start coming into play towards the back end of our five-year plan. But certainly, in the second half of this decade, I think you’re going to see a significant emphasis and need for transmission projects. So that’s really what I can tell you today. But as I’ll finish the way I started there, we’re excited about the opportunity because we think it’s significant and important."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Jeremy Tonet Got it. That’s helpful. We eagerly await there.
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet Maybe just pivoting over to the Missouri IRP here. Just wondering if you could share with us thoughts on next steps and I guess, how Rush Island plays into it, what we should be thinking about there?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Marty Lyons , Jeremy. Hey, how are you today? Appreciate the question. As it relates to the integrated resource plan, obviously, we filed last fall and as Warner said earlier in the prepared remarks, we continue to work with multiple developers with respect to several projects that would fit within that 1,200 megawatts of clean energy that we plan to deliver over the next several years consistent with that integrated resource plan. So we’re continuing to work on those, and we still expect to file with the commission still this year for approval of a portion of those project. So that work is going on. And then you mentioned the Rush Island Energy Center. And so as you saw in our slides today, in August, the court of appeals affirmed the District Court’s September 19 order. As we said in our slides and prepared remarks, we did file for a rehearing of that decision on October 18. So we do expect to hear back from the court and quite likely by the end of this year, we expect in terms of that rehearing. So it’s really premature to say what action we will take with respect to Rush Island at this point. We’ll wait to see whether there’s a rehearing. But that rehearing is denied and ultimately, we’re faced with that decision. Obviously, it may entail scrubbers in Rush Isla nd or the accelerated retirement of that plant, which might also include the utilization of the securitization legislation was passed earlier this year. So those are some of the things we’re looking at. Considerations as we think about those alternatives or things like customer rate impacts, replacement generation needs and importantly, reliability and investments that may be required in terms of transmission to the extent that Rush Island we re to be prematurely retired. So those are some of the considerations. I’ll tell you this, if ultimately a decision is made to retire Rush Island prematurely versus the day we had in our prior integrated resource plan that will require them that we file an updated integrated resource plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission. So stay tuned on that. Like I said, it’s premature to say how all of that will turn out, but that gives you a little bit of color on the potential path forward."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet Got it. That’s helpful. And just 1 last quick one, if I could. Just wondering if you might be able to comment on your generation position? And do you see any potential customer benefits under current market conditions right now?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Michael Moehn Hey, Jeremy, it’s Michael. Yes, I think we indicated in the prepared remarks in the slide that we historically have been long in the Missouri side. And so obviously, to the extent, that we’re able to take advantage of that in the marketplace is also some sales that flow back to customers through the fuel adjustment clause. So certainly, given where natural gas prices are, which is what the impact it’s having on power prices, it’s definitely a bit of a tailwind from a customer affordability standpoint."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dariusz Lozny Hey, . This is Dariusz on for Julien actually.  for taking my question. Can you just clarify, it was a little unclear from the opening remarks. Do you intend – or are you still evaluating whether or not you’ll file under a multiyear rate plan in Illinois in or before January 23?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Warner Baxter Yes. And just to give you a perspective, these workshops as you know, we talk about performance metrics. There’s a performance-based ratemaking perspective and concept incorporated in this legislation. So the performance metrics have to be determined, how you work through some of the details of the multiyear rate plan. These are things that stakeholders have to come to the table. And we look forward to working collaboratively with all of them next year."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dariusz Lozny Okay, . That’s very helpful color. And if I could pivot maybe to federal legislation, if I can. Have you quantified at all or thought about the potential upside impact on your credit metrics from direct pay, if that were included in final legislation?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Warner Baxter One thing you can miss assured is that me and my industry colleagues, we’re at the table to try and make sure that we get a constructive piece of federal legislation down across the board that will enable us to continue to move forward thoughtfully and effectively with the clean energy transition."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Dariusz Lozny .  very much. I’ll hop back on from here.
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Insoo Kim , Warner. How are you? My first question is on – the question on the Rush Island and the long-term generation plan. If the appeal process is unsuccessful. First of all, is it by the end of 2023 that you need to either put the scrubbers on or retire? Or is it 24? And then my – the related question to that is, as you think about potential changes to the plan if this had to shut early, given that long generation position? How do we think about some of the opportunities on the replacement side of things?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Marty Lyons Yes. , Insoo. Good to talk to you again. With respect to moving forward with scrubber, I think there, the expectation is that we would – if we went that route, as expeditiously as possible to put the scrubbers in place at Rush Island. So I’m not sure that there’s an exact time line. Obviously, the acquisition design, construction would take some time to get that put in place. And then with respect to the other route that you described, the retirement route, I think there, we’d be looking at how long Rush Island would continue to operate, obviously, given the things I talked about before, replacement generation needs, importantly, reliability issues around the system in the event of premature retirement, which again may necessitate some transmission investments in order to maintain reliability. So all of those things would be taken into consideration. And ultimately, to the extent that incremental generation was required or some acceleration of the clean energy transition that we’ve got laid out in our IRP, that would all be laid out in that updated integrated resource plan. So again, if we don’t move forward with the scrubber, if we do decide that the Rush Island needs to be shut down earlier than the day in our IRP, which was 2039, then we would move forward with an update to the Integrated Resource Plan. And again, and so that would assess all of the potential adjustments to generation need and timing that were laid out in that prior September Integrated Resource Plan filing."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Insoo Kim Got it.  for the color, Marty. The second question is on the grid 2021 guidance raising that by $0.10 as we think about the 2022, I know some of the weather benefit helped this year as well. But how do we think about some of the moving pieces that help 2021 that could potentially carry into 2022? And in that consideration slide, I didn’t see a specific mention to year-over-year low growth just curious on your base assumption there."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Warner Baxter Yes. Look, there’s a lot in that question there. Let me give you a couple of pieces, just in terms of the growth itself. I mean, year-to-date, we’ve put in there from a residential standpoint, we’re up 1.5%, commercial 3.5% and industrial 1%. So about 2%, and that’s really what we guided to at the beginning of the year in February. Now the mix is a little bit different. So we’re seeing some improvement in margin there, which is a driver of that increase in the midpoint that you talked about in addition to weather. So we – the plan remains on track with respect to that sales piece, that 2%, we see that sort of guiding in at the same point towards the end of the year. As we talked about at the beginning of the year, that will get us close to being back to 2019, but not quite. So I think the recovery continues, and we’re optimistic about we continue to see things open up here in both of our service territories in Missouri and Illinois. With respect to the guidance itself, I just remind you again, we really – in February last year, that 6% to 8% guidance was off of that midpoint. Obviously, at $375 million, that original midpoint of $375 million. We certainly have given you some select items to think about here in 2022. And then obviously, in February, we’ll roll all this forward to give you another look at capital as well as give you just more specifics about obviously, where our range will be in our earnings guidance for 2022 at that point in time. So hopefully, that give you a little bit of color you’re looking for."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Insoo Kim Got it. , and congrats, Marty and Warner both of you, and see you soon."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Hey, , Warner. Congratulations and to you  as well, Marty."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Maybe just can you talk about the 1.2 gigawatts in Missouri IRP. Just kind of what of that – what – how many – what portion of that capacity are you going to file for with the commission or get approvals for this year or early next year? Just as you’re thinking about your CapEx plan being extended another year, I’m thinking about how much of that 1.2 gigawatt might be layered in?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Michael Moehn , Marty. Just a couple of other small points on that $17 billion plan that we have out there, as Marty pointed out, there’s very, very little in there with respect to any of these renewable projects. Now we did indicate in that 10-year plan, that $40 billion plus, there is $3 billion of potential projects, which what Marty is referring to. So as we get more clarity on that timing, obviously, typically, what we do in February as we roll forward that capital plan, to be able to give you a bit more transparency about what the timing of that to the extent that we feel better about it and know it. So that’s just a little bit more color on exactly what’s there from a capital standpoint."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra I appreciate that detail. Then just shifting gears to Illinois, Obviously, now the – under the new framework, the ROE goes back to the ICC and they kind of come back with an ROE number. Just any early thoughts on how might they be calculating that? I mean we and investors have talked about sort of your gas assets there and the ROEs they’re getting in 9%-plus range. Just any – from your seat, just any early color into what ROE might look like or how might that be calculated? I appreciate that. ."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Warner Baxter Exactly. And we would expect the overall process and looking at that return on equity in terms of sort of a traditional look would be very similar. But obviously, with the multi-year rate plan, there may be some other factors that have come into us. So stay tuned."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra All right. I’ll leave it there. , guys."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Patterson Okay. So what I wanted to – first of all, I want to congratulate you guys. Is this your last call, Warner?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Warner Baxter Number one, . I’m truly excited about the new leadership structure and certainly the new roles that Marty and I are taking. And in terms of the last call, gosh, we’re taking one step at a time. We’re not saying this is my last call or anything like that. We’ll take that one step at a time. But you can kind of maybe in the EEI next week. That’s for sure."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Patterson And so just some – most of my questions have been answered, but a couple of quick ones for you. And I apologize for not knowing this, but what are no regrets projects I just don’t feel that grew blank. What does that mean?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Warner Baxter It’s probably a Warner term, right. So really, when you look at all these projects, I mean, some you can sit there and say, gosh, when we had to get we’re having these congestion areas when we had to get from point A to point B, we have these projects that are in the queue, there are certain of these regional projects, which really satisfy a lot of those transmission – or excuse me, renewable energy projects that are in the queue. And you do the analysis and you sit there and say, gosh, no one could be no one. I shouldn’t say that. It would be hard for people to argue that this isn’t a project that isn’t going to be significantly beneficial to the MISO footprint, frankly, to our country. So I can’t put those as no regrets, low risk, let’s call them that way. Lower-risk projects relatively speaking, compared to some that may have more complications. And so when you look at that scenario one, we think from our perspective, right, beauty’s in the – holder, but from our perspective, and we think there are several of those in there that need to be – they need to move forward. So that’s what I mean. We haven’t outlined which of those that we believe are there, and this is part of the collaborative process that we go through with MISO and other key stakeholders. But that’s how we think. Really lower risk is probably a better term to characterize those projects as."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Patterson Okay. Fair enough. And then sort of a technical question. There was this discovery dispute in the Missouri rate case on the Smart Energy Plan. And if you look to me like basically, they did to address in their testimony or rebottle or what have you. And I just wanted to make sure, has that really been resolved? I just wasn’t clear to me from what they were saying, they didn’t really seem to address it and the revenue requirement everything didn’t seem to penalize you or anything for the recommendation. So my question is, has that issue been taken care of?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Marty Lyons Paul, it’s Marty. I can’t say whether it’s been fully taken care of everybody’s satisfaction. I will tell you this, we do look to work constructively with all the parties in these rate reviews to get everybody the information they need in a timely basis to make decisions. And to your point, do not believe it’s an active issue in terms of a quantified difference between our position and the positions of others in the case. So hopefully, we have resolved that issue fully. But like you said, it’s not manifesting itself today in any kind of difference between the parties."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Patterson Okay. . And then finally, back to the 2024 question. I realize it’s very early, but it does seem like a big opportunity with – to the Illinois legislation. And I’m just wondering when you guys might incorporate it the potential outlook with it into your long-term guidance. I mean it doesn’t sound like it will be anything immediate, but I was just wondering, could it be a year from now or so that you guys would feel more comfortable talking about its potential benefit impact to the long-term growth outlook? Or would you be basically waiting until I guess, whenever the 2023 decision was made kind of, so to speak?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Marty Lyons Sure. Yes, Paul, this is Marty. It’s a fair question. We’ll provide a lot more guidance, right, on that specific question and others when we come with our longer-term guidance in February. We’ll give you our view, right, on how we think about the guidance that we set in and how we think about regulatory frameworks and all those types of things. So sit here today, obviously, nothing to change, nothing to talk about other than as we’ve said, we think it’s a constructive piece of legislation that we anticipate assuming that things go well in the workshops, so we would file for a multi-year rate plan. How we embed that into our long-term guidance in early 2022, stay tuned. We’ll be able to provide more detail on that."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Patterson Okay. Awesome. Well,  so much, and congratulations again and have a  one."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Paz H ey Warner, how are you doing? Congratulations on both of you and Marty."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Paz I just want to follow-up on a couple of quick questions. Just the following-up on the 1,200 megawatt maybe lots of Missouri question. I understand the spend is not in your stated outlook, financial outlook, but is any of the equity for that investment in your financing plan?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Michael Moehn Yes. Hey David, this is Michael. I mean that $17 billion plan again out there. The equity that we talked about back in third are really supports that $17 billion plan. It’s again sort of there by default that win is not in there, there’s no equity in there for."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Paz Got it. And then in an earlier question, Michael, did you say that you would be going forward your growth rate off of 2022 guidance or 2021 actuals when you were talking about the February update?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Michael Moehn Yes. I was just referring to last February, David, when we gave the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth guidance, it was off of that midpoint of 3.75%. And so that’s where people should continue to stay focused. We obviously gave you some 2022 select items here to think about in the third quarter, and then we’ll obviously roll forward stuff and give you a specific guidance in February of 2022."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Paz I see. Okay. . And maybe just a last question. I think Marty, can you provide an update maybe on just how settlement talks are going in the rate case or whether they’re still going?"
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Marty Lyons Yes. , David. The settlement talks really get going here over the next couple of weeks. We actually have, as we laid out in the slide, server battle testimony that’s actually do Friday. So I think all the parties are focused on that. And then soon after that, the parties will be pulling together reconciliations of the differences between our case and the updated positions of the staff, in particular, but also other parties. And then settlement discussions will get underway. As you know, again, is our – right now, the evidence you’re hearing are really scheduled to begin right after giving on November 29. So my expectation is that starting next week and all the way through that time period, there’ll be settlement discussions, hopefully, to narrow the issues and if possible, to resolve the entire case. Obviously, we have been successful in settling a number of cases that we’ve had over the past several years, including the last rate review. So we certainly expect to work towards that goal. And like I said, those discussions will really be happening between now and likely the beginning of those evidentiary hearings."
4465677,Ameren's,AEE,11/4/2021,CEO Warner Baxter on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Warner Baxter , David. See you next week. . And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. So I’ll now turn the call back over to Andrew Kirk for closing remarks.  for participating in this call. A replay of this call will be available for one year on our website. If you have questions, you may call the contacts listed on our earnings release. Financial inquiries should be directed to me, Andrew Kirk. Media should call Tony Paraino, Again,  for your interest in Ameren, and looking forward to seeing many of you next week at EEI. . . This concludes today’s conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andrew Lazar Just one from me. Your Europe trend is obviously remaining incredibly strong and accelerated on a 2-year basis. Even as many of those markets have been reopening at a faster pace than we've seen here in the U.S. So, I guess what are the learnings, if any from Europe, maybe that can help you inform the debate a bit in the group on whether some of the new households gain the past 2 years can be somewhat more sticky over time as markets in the U.S. more fully reopen?"
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steven Cahillane Yes. , Andrew. We have seen terrific growth in all of those international markets driven by increases in penetration and increases in buy rate. And so obviously those two things are important. They work in concert together and we've seen the business stick even as mobility has increased. And so, what we've always said is, we're looking at 2019 as a comparison, and obviously is still very relevant. The U.S. continues to open up slowly and we're hanging onto those buy rates, especially in the U.S. And so, we anticipate, even as the U.S. continues to open up, what we've talked about is the lasting impact is something we're confident in. And as we've said, time and again, our goal all along was to exit the pandemic stronger than when we went in. And we're more confident than ever that that's happening. That's absolutely happening."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Powers , and  from me as well. Two questions related to the supply of production backdrop in the U.S. First is can you give us some color on, how your service levels and fulfillment rates are holding up? How you expect them to trend for the fourth quarter and into the next -- into fiscal '22? Whether we should worry about, out-of-stocks accelerating or anything on that front? Relatedly, as you manage through these situations and you're pulling back, as you say, on investment spending, what's the risk as you see that begin to lose ground more structurally versus competition. I appreciate everyone's on the same boat directionally, but your situation is obviously a bit more severe at the moment. So, I'm wondering how you assess that risk. ."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Amit Banati And I think just on the investment levels, our investment levels are broadly flat versus a year ago, so while we pulled back on some supply constraint platforms, when I look at the overall level of investments, we're flattish. And in fact, our advertising is up, so we continue to invest at appropriate levels."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Stephen Powers Okay. Very good. And just to -- Amit on that point just -- is that -- does that -- I think that's a regional statement. Does that apply to the U.S. cereal as well?
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steven Cahillane And really Steve, based on supply, we're not, we're not going to advertise and promote heavy areas that are severely constrains at the moment."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Pamela Kaufman Hi. . I just had a question on -- I had a question on the guidance for the full year, so the full-year guidance implies a relatively wide range for Q4 top-line growth. Can you talk about the factors that would contribute to your results coming in towards the low versus the high end of the rates? And what impact are you expecting from the labor strike?"
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steven Cahillane Hi Pamela, so I'll start and Amit can pick up. So, what we've said is, we're taking a reasonable approach to what we think will happen with the labor strike, and that's in our guidance. Our top-line, obviously, continues with  momentum. But you heard what we said about the other three elements coming in perhaps more towards the lower end of the guidance. So, let me talk about what our thinking behind the strike and what I can share with you. We are in the process of negotiating right now. And so out of respect to that process, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail which I am sure you can appreciate. But we have always treated our employees with respect and fairness, and that includes industry-leading compensation and benefits. The offer that we have in front of the unit right now is increased compensation on top of that already industry-leading compensation and benefits, and we're not asking to take anything away, despite what you may have heard publicly. So, we think a fair resolution should be in the offing. We think that this type of offer is fair, reasonable, and again, increases on top of the industry-leading compensation already. So, this would allow our employees to get back to work. We want them back to work. I think they want to be back to work. But because these negotiations are ongoing, we can't go into much more detail than that, but I think -- we're hoping that we'll come to a reasonable conclusion. And that's what we're working towards."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Pamela Kaufman . And can you give more color on your growth margin expectations for the fourth quarter and how that will compare to the third quarter? And then just looking towards next year, do you think you've taken enough pricing and implementing enough productivity to preserve year-over-year gross margins?"
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steven Cahillane And Pamela, on the pricing which you asked about we're not going to comment on forward-looking pricing for obvious reasons. But I think if you look at where we are with price mix and you look at what we've been able to accomplish, that would be our goal going into the future. So obviously the very cost, it's a very inflationary environment driving up costs. Our first line of defense is always productivity. And as we plan out 2022, we'll plan for the same levels of productivity or er, and then look to the revenue growth management that we've successfully employed in order to protect our margins into next year."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steven Cahillane Yes. Ken, I appreciate the question, but I think you can appreciate, based on the sensitivity of where we are, and the fact that we're in negotiations, we're not going to be able to quantify any of that. We've taken what we think is a very reasonable view of getting to an agreement. We've also taken into account the contingency plans that we have in effect. We knew -- we've been talking for a year now, because we had a year extension, we knew the contract was expiring on October 5th, so we took all sorts of measures to prepare ourselves, including building inventory. Building inventory was a little bit challenge because of the fire in Memphis, but we also have deployed our white-collar workers, we've deployed outside labor to keep the plants running, to get the plants running, they're gaining productivity each and every day. We've also leveraged our global supply chain network for cereal to also mitigate. And so, we're working very, very hard on two fronts to mitigate the effects of the strike. On the one hand, and we're doing that successfully and getting better every day. But also, to get our workers back to work. We want them to get their paychecks, we want them to enjoy their healthcare. We truly want them back to work and we think we've got a very, very good proposal.  Again, with increases on top of already industry-leading compensation. So, I think reasonable heads should prevail, based on all that. And that's the view that we're taking. We want to get to a negotiated settlement, get back to work, and we think we've given the best guidance that we can based on all those different factors."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Goldman  for that. And then a quick question follow-up just thinking about modeling on it. You've had similar adjusted SG&A the last couple of quarters, a little under $720 million. As we think about a run rate, going forward, is that a reasonable number? I know it's going to vary, obviously from quarter-to-quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense because we've had some ups from the last year. What we should be thinking about going ahead here."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Amit Banati Overall, I'd say flattish to 2019 levels is kind of a good run rate to assume Ken. I think the sales has been phasing. We're lapping the phasing of the brand-building and obviously we also lapping the incentive compensation accruals from last year."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nik Modi I was hoping maybe you can just -- . I was hoping you can give us some context on inflation just kind of the key buckets in how you see that playing out. And then Steve, if I could throw in a question to you just strategically and philosophically, we're obviously seeing a lot of onetime events that are causing a lot of disruption of these one-time events feel like they just keep on happening. So, I wanted to get your thoughts on capex and doesn't make sense to just have a super cycle in the near-term, just to automate as much as possible and just really evolved the infrastructure to be ready for handling these tend to shock? ."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steven Cahillane And Nick, it's a really interesting question that you raised strategically, and I think for everybody, the pandemic has brought all sorts of different consequences, right? And it's almost an old joke by now, there's no pandemic playbook, but we've all had different challenges, some very common and some unique. Unique to us to obviously is a fire that we talked about, the strike that we're dealing with ri ght now. So, there's clearly some uniqueness. But I think one thing that we are definitely looking towards is how we continue to grow. Because despite this, we've had lots of I wouldn't call it pockets, we've got real growth happening in most of our business that is very resilient, robust, and sustainable. But the future of work is clearly going to change and our capital plans over the next couple of years will reflect that. When I say the future of work, the obvious -- what happens in office environments, where work gets done, how work gets done, but then also, from a capacity standpoint, and how factories run, and where work gets done there, where product gets made to allow ourselves even more resiliency going forward is clearly something that is on the cards for us."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Palmer . . You mentioned that in, I think it was answer to Ken 's question and the high-single-digit inflation in the fourth quarter. If input costs remain at these current levels and considering contracts and hedges rolling off, will the -- will COGS inflation slow in the first half of '22 or remain near those high-single-digit levels? And I have a quick follow-up."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Amit Banati Yeah. I think we'll obviously provide detailed guidance right in our quarter 4 earnings call in early February. I think to your question on from an inflation standpoint, I think on a planning basis, we're assuming that the high levels of inflation will persist for the foreseeable future. But I think that's what -- that's the assumption that we're working with. I think from a hedging standpoint, we have a continuous hedging process, so they continue to roll. So, we do not anticipate any sudden cliff at the start of the year. that said, obviously the hedges are rolling up at higher prices. And so, from a lapped standpoint, the current hedges are higher than the hedges that are dropping off. And so all-in-all, we're planning for a high inflation environment in 2022. I think you don't from a shortages and disruption standpoint, that's harder to predict. But we are assuming that they will persist. And so, from a productivity standpoint and from our revenue growth management standpoint, we will be taking actions in '22 to offset them and continuing to drive balanced financial delivery."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Palmer And  for that. And if we were to look back where we can almost, now, look at '21 with pretty good visibility, I would imagine. And if you were to look at the friction costs, COVID related, strike related, just put it all into one bucket and God willing, you'll be able to lap these friction costs with less friction in '22. But how would you say or estimate those friction costs have been a drag to your gross margins in 21, I'll pass it on."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Laurent Grandet Yes. , everyone. And 2 questions. The first one is more follow-up actually. You said in your per remark, U.S. shipments were lagging behind consumption. So, what is the current level of inventory at retailers? And how it compares to rate should be. So that's the first question. The second one is really about Europe. It's from a strong gross in Europe this quarter were higher than what we expected. And you mentioned in your pro-market performance was driven by the U.K. and Russia. So, could you please give us a bit more color there? There were so -- I mean, we heard about disruption and the neighboring that truck drivers into U.K. And are you seeing any kind of disruption there in the U.K? but also in shipments between the U.K and Europe? ."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steven Cahillane Yes. . Laurent, I'll start and then Amit can fill in as well. From a U.S. shipment standpoint, I would say shipments are lagging consumption probably mid-single digits is probably a reasonable assumption there. I'd say inventory levels across the whole landscape are low, obviously. It's been well-documented in all the supply chain challenges and disruptions and so forth. In terms of Europe, I mean Europe team continues to deliver at a very high level. And if you look at the UK and Russia performance, we highlighted that and if you look at across Pringles and Cereal and the Wholesome Snacks has bounced back, as we said as well. And so, it's really just high levels of execution, lapping a very strong performance last year and continued demand creation activities that have been very, very successful in terms of the disruptions, there clearly are disruptions. They're not quite as acute as they are in the U.S., but they are real. There's friction also that has to do with Brexit. When you think about supply chain that is on Continental Europe, as well as the UK. We're working our way through that. You're seeing good results despite that. But the same issues around freight and truck drivers exist in the UK and in Continental Europe, but particularly the UK as they do in the U.S. as well."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Robert Moskow Hi. One of your big competitors is talking about price increases beginning in January and snack. And there's a lot of [Indiscernible] food companies that are introducing new pricing. Can you talk a little bit about like what your plans are for pricing in 2022? What have you talked to the trade about so far? And then a quick follow-up?
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Amit Banati And I think if you look at our -- quick look backwards, our price mix has been at around 4% and within that actually mix has been negative because of -- in this quarter, because of country mix. And so not only is that of -- not only the 4% offsetting the mix. But obviously the pricing is at a high level than that. So, it's coming through."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Robert Moskow Okay. My follow-up on plant-based. You said that the category is declining as you expected off of tough comps. Is there a risk that these declines continue into next year? When do you think it comes back to positive again?
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steven Cahillane Yeah, Rob, I think it does come back to positive next year. The lap is really what's occurring right now. And if you go back to see what happened 2 years ago. There was an enormous excitement  around the new entrants. Lots of new distribution being built. Lots of doors, frozen doors, refrigerated doors being added. And so, we always anticipated, as we said, that the hurdle of that would be difficult. But when you look to consumer behavior, when you look to the consumer research we have, there's still a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around plant-based. And so, we think going into next year, you start to see healthier growth rates on a year-over-year basis because of those comps."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Christopher Growe Quick question for you on mix as you were talking to Rob there. Does lower mix at the revenue line mean lower mix at the profit line, whether it be gross profit or operating profit? So, is that a factor weighing on your gross margin as well?"
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Amit Banati Not necessarily. I think it's -- there are 2 factors in play at a high level. One is obviously your geographic mix. A Multipro, it does impact both NSP and gross margin because it's a distributor business. And obviously in quarter 3, like we -- like I mentioned, we had a huge quarter in Multipro in Nigeria, driven really by pricing to cargo inflation and volume growth was strong despite the significant pricing that came through. On that one, it flows through. I think on the categories, I'd say it's a lot more balanced between snacks and cereal."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Christopher Growe Okay. And then I had a second question just around pricing and two elements of that. One would be that you noted the Europe pricing to offset inflation, but some of these disruptions and supply chain challenges are -- have been an issue for your gross margin. As you, I think you noted as well that you expect those to continue next year. So, does that mean that your pricing would be below whatever the total amount of inflation is next year if the supply chain challenges don't get better? And then if I could add to that, you talked about a low level of plasticity, especially in the emerging markets to pricing, does that push you to price even more there than what you would expect around the level of inflation in those markets? ."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Amit Banati I think to the extent that we can focus the disruptions. I think it's hard to focus and that's been the challenge this year, because it's just common in so many unexpected places. I think to the extent that it's sustained and we're able to focus it. Obviously, that will go into the mix of how we offset through productivity and revenue growth management. So, I think that's the way we're thinking about it. I think to the areas that we think that's going to persist, we'll obviously take actions to offset that. And I think on your point on emerging markets, yes, the volume has come through stronger than we had expected. And so, I think elasticities have been lower. No question."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Zaslow That you have with Pringles and where you think that the new markets will be. And when you think about it in a couple of years, how big you think this brand will be?"
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steven Cahillane Yes, , Ken. So, we're very excited about the Pringles momentum obviously. It's a  brand, it's highly differentiated. It handles innovation extremely well. It carries flavor, like no other snack. And so, we see continued growth in the markets where we are. It's got pretty good distribution countrywide. So, most of the growth is going to come from continuing to penetrate and increased by rates and household penetration in some of the developing markets. You've seen in Central Brazil and other emerging markets quite successfully so. And we put a couple of lines in our Brazilian plant for Pringles as well. The Malaysia plant has been running strong for us and that provides good growth opportunities across Asia. So, we think -- I'm not going to predict how big it can get, but it keeps getting bigger for sure and generating very solid growth for us. The other thing I'd mention where we have a lot of opportunity from snack and expanding distribution Cheez-It, which doesn't have the same footprint as Pringles, not even close. And we've now launched in Canada and Brazil and it's done extremely well. So now, as we look to the globe, we look to brands like Cheez-It and even Pop-Tarts and others that would have global aspirations. And s o, we continue to look at our Snacks portfolio as something very exciting with a lot of growth potential."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Zaslow My second question is, for the last couple of quarters, you've tried to temper the emerging markets growth. This is probably the first quarter you haven't done that. And you continue -- you actually sound a little bit more optimistic about the outlook emerging markets. Not that you haven't been optimistic, but you're not trying to taper off expectations on that. What are you seeing in emerging markets to give you increased confidence that maybe this is much more sustainable than you may have thought for the last 3 quarters to 4 quarters. And unless I misread what you're thinking. And I'll leave it there [Indiscernible]."
4465682,Kellogg Company,K,11/4/2021,CEO Steven Cahillane on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Amit Banati And I think if you looked at our prepared remarks, we talked about growth accelerating. We saw it all the way through last year, and it's further accelerated. So, we had double-digit growth through the year. Overall, it's been sustained through the year, through last year. And I think from a growth standpoint, we continue to see it as a growth opportunity."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet  to see the rating agencies starting to pay attention to the improving metrics here. But I want to focus more on the 2022 outlook here, and just wondering if you could provide us more color on what you're seeing as far as producer activity in your footprint is concerned. This year we've seen kind of a bifurcation of private versus publics with the privates being more aggressive. Do you see similar trends like that continuing into 2022 or is there anything different there? And I think you've talked about processing plant every 18 months or so. Is that still kind of the current expectation?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Matt Meloy Yes. Hey, Jeremy. I'd say, it really is probably more of the same from us for our larger E&Ps and larger publics and integrated. They are really sticking more or less with what they have told us. They have some ranges in their forecast they give us, but more or less are kind of sticking to the plans that they have. And we are still seeing a lot of the uptick in activity from the smaller and private guys really across our systems. I don't see a big change happening there. And then in terms of adding processing plants, last call we talked about adding the Legacy Plant, we just had Heim Plant come online, and we're ordering long lead times now for the next plant in the Permian Midland. So as we're really working through our, I'd say, capital budgeting and planning for 2022, we're ordering long lead times so we can be ready. We're not sure exactly when we think we'll need the next plant after Legacy, so we're still kind of in that evaluation phase, but we want to be ready in there for customers when it comes in. So I guess, stay tuned. When we think that next plant will come in, we would likely announce more specifics around timing on the next earnings call."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet Got it. That's helpful. . And maybe just touching on capital allocation,  to see the dividend show up a little bit early and ahead of what we were looking for. But just wondering if you could just walk us through maybe the priorities of the waterfall here. It seems like you're able to do multiple things at once, but just kind of curious if that's how you think about it or how you prioritize? And just when it comes to buybacks, is it just going to be solely opportunistic or could there be some programmatic side to it?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale I'd say, Jeremy, clearly the near-term priority is now we're in excellent position to take out the DevCos in January and leverage will move a little bit higher when we do that, but then we expect to leverage to come down thereafter as we benefit from increasing EBITDA, not only in company's assets. but from the rest of the business. And that's what's really going to drive a lot of the flexibility that we see us having in 2022 that will allow us to return capital to our shareholders in a variety of ways. The simplification is still an important part of this for us  though, and that starts with the DevCo and then also taking out the preferred. And that's what we'll largely be focused on in 2022. But again, I think we now have the flexibility to think about a go forward where we've got increasing EBITDA, which allows us to return more capital through both increasing dividends and potentially decreasing share count. And that's what we'll be focused on as we go forward through time, assuming a continued strong balance sheet."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shneur Gershuni , everyone. From my perspective, not a lot of big picture questions. I think you guys have real ly answered the questions on return of capital, dividend increases today, timing of simplification. Congratulations on that, very much appreciated. Maybe just some smaller type questions. First of all, just with respect to the ramp in the Permian and so forth, appreciate the color that you gave, privates version publics. Wondering if you can talk about it more geographically. Any sense on how the ramp is going to work in the Delaware? Are you seeing any increased activity there or some shifts and so forth? Just kind of wondering if anything has kind of changed in terms of producer conversations or activity around that."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Pat McDonie I think it's pretty csonsistent across both the Midland side of the basin and the Delaware side of the basin. We're seeing the steady growth from the large publics, as Matt alluded to, and we're seeing more activity levels in both the Delaware and the Midland side of the basin from the smaller guys. And certainly, when you look at rig count adds, etc., it kind of indicates that there's probably a little more lag in the Delaware than there is in the Midland side of the basin. But certainly, in our conversations with those parties we contracted with, they're definitely ramping up in some form or fashion. Not crazy ramp up, but good, thoughtful investment of capital. So that's what we're seeing right now."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shneur Gershuni .  for that. And then as a follow-up question, obviously, there's a lot going on from an inflation perspective right now. Many of your peers have talked about the fact that they have PPI or CPI style in players and the vast majority of their contracts, whether it's G&P, whether it's long haul pipes and so forth. Kind of curious if you can update us on where receipts in that respect. We have an inflator adjuster in there. Do your contracts in the Permian in general have those types inflators as well too?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale Shneur, this is Jen. I think similar to a lot of our peers, we have escalators across our contracts both in G&P and also in Logistics and Transportation. So we would expect going forward that we're in that beneficiary of inflation. And so that's part of what would be a potential tailwind for us next year and then the go forward after that."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Devries This is Mark on for Christine. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on your discussions with the rating agencies. Obviously, with the continued strong results, it seems like you're well on your way to IG. But just curious how you're thinking about the path forward? And then as a second part to that, it would seem like you're trending below your long-term leverage target for next year. So could that open up capacity for share repurchases or how should we think about that?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale Mark, this is Jen. I think that we are in an excellent dialogue with the rating agencies. I think from our perspective, we already have strong investment-grade metrics. And so have spent a lot of time with the agencies to make sure that they understand what our short, medium and long-term strategies are and really get comfortable with the direction that we're headed in. And I think with the recent upgrades from S&P and now Moody's, they're recognizing the progress that we've continued to make. And then Fitch with their initial rating, I think spent a lot of time with us to understand where we are and what the vision was going forward. So I think we're in a good position with all three. What has been articulated to us is that the DevCo repurchase in their minds is an important step for us in our simplification. So we'll do that in January of 2022. Leverage will move a little bit higher just as a result of where leverage is now and where we expect it to be at year end and then we'd expect it to come down thereafter. So I think we're really well positioned. And our hope is that it will be a 2022 event that we become investment-grade. And then obviously, we don't control the timing of that, but we’ll continue to be in dialogue with the agencies to figure out what the appropriate timing is for us. And then related to the second part of your question, can you just remind me what that was?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Mark Devries Just that you’re trending below your long-term leverage target for next year. So does that open up any capacity for share repurchases or how should we just think about that?
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale I think, hopefully, what you’ve heard from us this morning is that we’re really excited about where we’re positioned today and the flexibility that that affords us going forward. We focused on reducing leverage this year. And you’ve heard already that in our minds there is a shift in 2022 where we’re able to return more capital to our shareholders. And to the extent we are able to continue to manage leverage where it is and where we expect it to go, I think that increases our flexibility to do a lot of different things that will improve the return of capital to our shareholders and increase the value of Targa as we move through time."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Mark Devries . Appreciate that. And then looks like your implied G&P fees came in pretty strong again this quarter. How should we think about that going forward into 2022? It looks like you are above the fee floor levels at this point. And  should we think there is a cap to how much upside the volumes on these contracts can participate in?
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Matt Meloy Yes. So you are correct in that our fee floors were put in place to protect the downside. And right now, our average NGL is around $1.06 and gas prices are much higher than they were last year. So we are above the fee floors on our POP contract. So the way those generally work is they’re still POP contracts, percentage-of-proceeds, just has a fee floor in them. So as prices will continue to move up, it will look like a regular POP contract."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Colton Bean . So I’ll stick with the leverage theme there. So Jen, you mentioned exiting 2021 near the low end, it seems likely that you’ll be able to fund the DevCo buying with free cash. So even if there is a little bit of a tick higher in early parts of the year as you move through the balance of 2022 and certainly to 2023, it seems likely that you’ll be below that 3x to 4x range. So just conceptually, can you update us how you think about the appropriate level of debt on the business? Should we expect an updated leverage target over time? Really just interested in kind of broader thoughts there."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale Our long-term target is 3x to 4x, Colton, and that’s not something that I would expect that we’ll be updating. We’re very comfortable within the 3x to 4x range. That doesn’t mean that we couldn’t have quarters or quarters where we’re lower or even higher than that. I think we’re very comfortable existing anywhere around that zip code. To the extent we’re in the lower end or even below, that gives us more flexibility. So we’ll just be continuing to manage our balance sheet as we go through time. But again, very comfortable within the 3x to 4x range and that’s really over the long-term where we expect to manage the business."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Colton Bean Got it. And then just on the Series A, any thoughts as to the cadence we should expect over the course of 2022 there?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale The base plan that we have right now is that we’ll ratably take it out beginning really in the second quarter after it steps down to 105, and that will continue until, call it, the end of 2023 when it will be fully redeemed at that point in time. But to the extent that we want to take some out sooner, we obviously have that flexibility. So that’s a lever that we’ll be able to pull as we move through 2022 just depending on the performance of the business and the outlook for the business."

Congrats from me as well on the dividend and the capital allocation investment. Wanted to touch on the 2022 CapEx comment, signaled at little higher year-over-year. Just curious if you could kind of talk about how much of that is from increasing activity? You mentioned the Midland plants and Grand Prix pumps, but is there any of that also coming from any inflation on the sourcing side? ."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Matt Meloy Yes. No, really I think as we look for 2022 CapEx, it’s really more related to our – this increase in activity out in the Permian. We’re looking to exceed our guidance on volumes for this year, ordering long lead times, it looks like we’re going to have more plant capital as you get into 2022, and then also, it’s just more volumes, more gathering compression pipelines and the like. So I’d say it’s more related to that. We are seeing some higher costs for steel and other things. The team has done a really good job for whether it’s Legacy or even this next plant we’re kind of getting in the Q4 a re trying to manage that as best we can. There will be some pressures on that, but I’d say it’s primarily related to more activity than just inflation."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Mackay All right. That’s helpful. . And then maybe just following-up on your comments around the export downtime this quarter. Just curious if, one, you could kind of frame-up how much of the lower margin, lower volumes quarter-over-quarter was the downtime versus shifts in kind of the overall macro? And then maybe you can kind of just give us a snapshot maybe on where exports sit right now? ."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Scott Pryor Hey, John. Yes, as it relates to the third quarter, first of all, we performed on our term-related contracts as it relates to that working with all of our term customers. But we opted to do the maintenance at our facility during the quarter. And really doing that against the backd rop of the fact that there was a softer market globally and the result of really less arb opportunity. So we foregoed, if you will, the opportunity to sell some additional spot cargos across our dock. That teases up very well as we move into the fourth quarter domestically. Prices have kind of stabilized here. We’ve seen increases in the arb and the opportunities across the market to the Far East and other areas. So I think it puts us in good position obviously to perform very well in the fourth quarter, not only for our term-related contracts, but taking advantage of the opportunity to move additional spots across the dock. So I think we’re in good position there."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unidentified Analyst Hey, , everyone. This is Doug on for Spiro. Maybe just to start on one on margins, a few peers have talks this quarter about frac T&F becoming more competitive in the Permian. Just wondering if you’re seeing similar pressure on margins? And if so, kind of what it takes to scale back toward midstream?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Matt Meloy Yes, sure. Right now, I would agree with that assessment that the T&F market is very competitive. There is excess capacity. And so new deals that are coming, it’s very competitive, and there’s a lot of competition to get the marginal barrel there. I’d say the good thing for Targa is we have, we are underpinned by either long-term contracts if it’s a T&F agreement. We have long-terms, a lot of them are 10-plus years, our longer term T&F contracts. And then in our Gathering and Processing business, we have long-term contracts on the G&P side. So most of the volumes that are coming and most of the volumes that are underpinning our growth are already contracted for multiple years to come. So I’d say, while we are in that same market, we’re still very well positioned for the next several years because of our contract structure."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unidentified Analyst Okay. Got it. That’s helpful. . And then maybe just to follow-up on the dividend, realized the next decision is a little ways away, but this quarter you kind of referenced that 30% of free cash flow around the dividend increase. As we look towards what the next increase could look like, is that a good reference point to think about? Are there other metrics you’re looking at in terms of determining how big of an increase you could see next time?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale Doug, this is Jen. When we think about 2022, there is still a little bit for us to continue to work through related to the corporate simplification, right? So primary use of free cash flow in 2022 will be the DevCo repurchase. As we think about beyond that, I think we’ll wait to articulate more about our plans. We tried to give a reference point that said that setting the dividend at $1.40 for the fourth quarter we were looking at how much of 2021 free cash flow that represented and are very comfortable with the dividend that approximates to call it 30% of this year’s free cash flow. But as we move through time, that could change. And so I’d say that that’s something that we will continue to evaluate. We have said that we think that we will be in position to return more capital to shareholders as we move through time. And so how much free cash flow that means we are comfortable paying out on any given year will be dependent on our performance for that year and then our expectations for the go forward as well."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unidentified Analyst All right, . That is all from me. ."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Blum . , everyone. I think I know the answer to this, but just wanted to confirm the transaction that was just announced for the Pioneer acreage. I assume that includes acreage tied to your assets and I assume the contracts will just move and there will be no really change from your perspective. Just wanted to confirm that."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Pat McDonie Yeah, that is correct.  The Continental acquisition of Pioneer acreage, a lot of it is dedicated to us and it will just move over with the existing dedication."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Blum . Perfect, . And then I know it’s early, but I wanted to kind of get your read on the EPA’s proposal to regulate methane emissions. Do you see this as a potential costs for your business or is it potentially a positive upside, for example, producers are no longer permitted to flare any natural gas? Just want to get your thoughts there. ."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Matt Meloy Sure. Yes, with the proposed additional regulations from the EPA, I’d say, as we look through those, we’re in overall agreement with what they’re trying to do, and that’s trying to keep methane in the facilities, which makes sense. We’re already operating with best practices in a lot of these areas. So the recommendations they are putting forth we’re already doing in a lot of the areas, and we’ve been retrofitting and making changes for years doing this. So this may perhaps speed that along some work t hat we’re already doing. We’re already looking and trying to find leaks along our pipelines and facilities. As outlined in our ESG report, we’re hiring third-parties to fly, kind of going above and beyond and flying our facilities looking for leaks and fixing them. So overall, this is things we’ve already done. It puts some more parameters in place, which we’ll have to follow. But I don’t see that as being an issue for us, it’s things we were already doing. And then an opportunity, I’d say, as we provide really good service to our customers and can have good metrics there, yes, I think there is some potential opportunity as we kind of become leading in this and continue to perform very well. That could be beneficial for some of the larger E&Ps who are focused on our overall performance there."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Keith Stanley . . So appreciating there’s rounding involved in your disclosures, but I was looking at the year-end leverage expectation of 3.25 versus 3.50 last time. If I kind of look at debt outstanding, that implies a pretty big increase in EBITDA for the year, it would be like $2.1 billion for 2021. Is that a possibility based on the math or am I over thinking that and it’s just rounding involved?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale I mean, clearly, we’re not giving specific numbers on exactly what our expectation is right now for full year adjusted EBITDA. I think we do have a pretty good outlook for the fourth quarter. And now that we’re a month into the fourth quarter, feel good about it. But ultimately, we’ll have to see how the next couple of months shake out and how we finish up the year. But yes, I mean, prices are strong, fundamentals are strong. We do expect increasing volumes really across the business this quarter so to the extent that those materialize. I think it should end up being a pretty good quarter for Targa and that will drive a very nice 2021 overall adjusted EBITDA year for the company."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Keith Stanley , . And second question. The Midland plants just in Q3, I mean, they look like they are already running above nameplate even with Heim. Should we assume you’re somewhat limited on Midland growth until Legacy starts up or can you still kind of flex those facilities higher and meet, I guess, demand?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Pat McDonie Yes. We have the ability to get some incremental capacity out of the plate above – out our plants above nameplate. When you think about the size of our Midland system and then number of plants that we have, and let’s just say, we’ve got 10% at least capability above nameplate, it’s a pretty substantial amount of incremental capacity that allows us to go ahead and continue to handle all of our producers’ volumes, while we’re building that next plant and putting that incremental capacity in place. Does that answer your question?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Keith Stanley So 10% above nameplate you think you can get to if needed?
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Pat McDonie I think that’s very comfortable, I’ll put it that way, and some of our facilities have capabilities beyond that 10%."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chase Mulvehill Hey, , everyone.  for squeezing me in here. I guess, one quick follow-up to Keith’s question. If you were to run out of capacity in Midland before kind of Legacy comes on, and I know you said you could squeeze more out above nameplate, is it possible for you to move any kind of wet gas over to the Delaware and process the gas there?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Pat McDonie Yes. We do have some capability of moving gas from the Midland site to the Delaware site. And frankly, looking at ways to improve our capability of doing so. So some looking to grow that. And certainly, we have the ability to offload to peers in the marketp lace that having incremental available capacity. So we feel pretty good about our ability to handle the growth in volumes before our next plant comes up just based on the fleet of plants that we currently have. But we certainly have some other flexibility."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chase Mulvehill Okay, . Unrelated follow-up. I know we’ve kind of talked about this a lot on the call so far about capital allocation, but it sounds like excess free cash is going to go to the DevCo buy-in and retiring some of the preferreds, and at some point, you’re going to look at buybacks. So can I ask a question on buybacks? Like, how are you approaching buybacks? Is it kind of more of a planned and measured program each quarter or will it be more opportunistic and price sensitive?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale We’ve characterized it as opportunistic, Chase. So it’s really going to depend on what’s happening in a given quarter and what’s our outlook for the year, what’s our outlook beyond that. And so we’ll look under – we’ll look at that decision under a number of different frameworks. But I think hopefully what you’re hearing fr om us is that with the balance sheet flexibility we now feel that we have, it certainly can be part of how we’re going to return capital to shareholders. But we’re not going to provide clarity under the frameworks under which we will or will not participate in the market."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Chase Mulvehill Okay. And noticeably absent was any mention of a special or potential special dividend. Is that off the table?
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jen Kneale I think from our perspective, everything always has to be on the table. We’ve clearly articulated that as we think about our priorities for 2021. It was managing our leverage lower. And then for 2022, it’s really continuing corporate simplification with the DevCo and the preferred, while also being able to return more capital to shareholders, which I think initially we’re talking about in terms of paying a higher base common dividend and then also potentially being able to engage in some opportunistic repurchases. But everything is always on the table, and that’s what we work through with our Board each and every quarter to make decisions. From our perspective, that’s not something that makes sense for us today, but that doesn’t mean that that couldn’t change in the future."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chase Mulvehill Okay, perfect. I’ll turn it back over. , Jen."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sunil Sibal Yes, hi. , everybody, and  for all the color. So my first question is related to the M&A. So obviously, we continue to see fair bit of M&A in the upstream space and some has also started in the midstream side also not too far away from your footprint. So my question was, now that you’ve kind of got the company to where you want it to be over the longer term, how do you look at M&A in the midstream space going forward?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Matt Meloy Yeah, sure. . I think for us, it’s really been – it’s really going to be more of the same. I think we’re going to continue to have a high hurdle for us. We have a really good organic growth projects outlook to continue to grow that. So we’re not in a position of need where we feel like we have to go get something to complete our integrated story or that we are really falling short in any area. So we’ll continue to look at assets. We have looked over the last several years. If there is something that’s complementary to our existing assets and it fits well on the G&P side and it has liquid synergies, so it’s a good G&P business with some liquids, we will look at that as we’ve continued to look at it, but we also want to make sure if we do anything there, we’re staying within our 3x to 4x target leverage. So it’s kind of got to be just right for us. So we haven’t really found anything that’s fit that, but we’ll continue to look. But it continues to be a high bar because we have – we think we’re going to able to grow our EBITDA just through organic growth."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sunil Sibal Got it.  for that. And my second question related to the ESG initiatives. So obviously, you’ve signed up for solar power through PPAs. I was just curious, should we kind of think about that as the line you intend to take as you look at your ESG initiatives or there could be more kind of meaningful participation there?"
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bobby Muraro Yes. I think the way we think about it, this is Bobby, as we look at all these projects that either fit our capital profile or third-party capital profile. So to the extent we can go to low carbon projects that supply power to our assets or carbon capture or something else that we’re willing to fund on our balance sheet or someone else is willing to fund on their balance sheet, we will look to do those projects. I think this is the first example of one where there were someone that was willing to build a solar project that fit within the parameters we want to do from a low carbon standpoint and their return parameters. It probably didn’t hit our return parameters, which is why you won’t see us put money in the projects like that. But to the extent we start to fund ones that do, that will be part of the evaluation going forward. I wouldn’t set a standard to what we would or wouldn’t do, but that’s kind of how the  analysis goes internally."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sunil Sibal Got it.  for all the color, and congratulations on the good update."
4465690,Targa Resources',TRGP,11/4/2021,CEO Matt Meloy on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bobby Muraro , Sunil. There are no further questions. Presenters, please continue. Well,  everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. , and have a  day. And with that, this concludes today’s conference call.  for attending. You may now disconnect."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza Excellent. Dan nice to hear your voice. But just a couple of quick questions here. Tom, a lot of investors are hoping to hear more about your [Indiscernible] capex opportunities at EEI next week, especially kind of with your Georgia and Alabama IRP next year. Can you remind us of some of the types and size of the incremental capex we could see when you roll the capex plans forward next February. Maybe offer some ballpark figures to help frame the opportunity set as you shut down coal, how you'll finance it, what the impact the rates could be, I mean I understand things will shift between now and then, but any comment would be ."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Tom Fanning But it's a good thing for us. Good thing for our customers we get to iterate around those choices. You don't get that opportunity in the organized markets.
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza Got it.  for that and I know lastly for me, I know there's a lot of focus on exactly which month in the three will be in service next year, but I'm a little bit more interested, on what happens once it's online. So once you get three comes online, how should we think about what that means for earnings and cash flows in light of the TSC proven that joint settlement with the staff this required I know there's a lot of moving parts with the NCCR AFDC. The penalty ROE, but just really at a high level, what are the immediate impacts to cash flows and earnings following Unit 3 reaching the service.  guys."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Drew Evans Important thing is that $2.1 billion is not the full cost of Unit 3 and the common facilities, what remains will remain earning a return under NCCR, or will be deferred for future recovery with the Commission. And at the same time, we will be recovering currently, the operating costs of Unit 3 and the depreciation, at least the associated with a $2.1 billion."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza Got it. That was super helpful. , guys. I appreciate the  execution."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith A quite well , Tom. Pleasure, clinical team congrats Dan to o. Let's just dive right in on the asset sale for the year. You obviously made some pretty interesting comments some moment ago. Just wanted to clarify there is you think about regulated versus perhaps some of the other assets you own that Southern Power or otherwise, what exactly are you thinking about there and then more importantly, what equity need are you kind of thinking about here? Obviously, it's not -- it doesn't seem as least as explicitly stated to substantive here. But can you talk about how you're thinking about equity needs, especially considering some of the prospective capex you alluded to. I expect that feeds into this commentary on asset sales to."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Drew Evans Yes absolutely. So Julien, essentially,  what we're addressing is only the impact of the recent Vogtle cost increases. So to the extent that that has an impact on our credit profile, we're committed to mitigating that. Whether that's turning our drip on or finding opportunities with these asset sales. Beyond that, we still see a long-term plan, even in light of the incremental capex opportunities that we're alluding to where we don't need incremental equity. I think it's important to point towards a post Vogtle kind of forecast period. And our credit metrics out there are about 200 basis points for FFO to debt higher than they are today. And that's a position of strength for us and gives us a lot of flexibility as to how we finance our group. And I just want to clarify, just back on source question that I said 1/3 of a cent per month. It's 2/3 of a cent per month, I just want make sure that's clear."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Okay. Yeah. And to be very clear to o, I'm trying to be less elliptical on what we're looking at. But you should assume, as we have moved here to be, what is it, 95% of our earnings are integrated regulated kind of earnings that it would contribute to that profile. In other words, we're not going to buy ourselves things which make ourselves more risky. I think we love the idea of reasonable turn and low risk. And also as you have seen in the past years or since I've been here. As we have bought say for example, AGL Resources now Southern Company Gas, there had been things around the edges that have allowed us to simplify and de -risk our business. So think about those things and we'll see how it goes."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Excellent. And then just coming back to Unit floor, obviously, you made some comments a moment ago about some of the labor availability, etc. and remediation work. I mean, how do you get comfortable with the nine month time gap between those two units in service date. But I'm just calling out that staffing stated at to various points about sort of the concerns that they have, on the second unit and service."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Yeah. Julian. Yes.  for that. It's an important point to raise as has the ties at both ebbs and flows here. Let me explain that a little bit. We believe that Bechtel has had the responsibility to attract skilled personnel, skilled craftwork, especially electrician engineers, to assess the work that's being done and field site personnel, supervisory personnel to oversee the work that's going on. We have not kept pace with the requirements to advance these units in terms of attracting the people, and you named the reason why we've had more attrition. I think certainly the amount of attrition is potentially associated with the COVID response and everything else. So we've had to do a couple of different things. We have said in the past that we were moving to de -link the progress at Unit 4 from Unit 3. And so therefore, this 12-month margin didn't matter. One of the way that we serve to continue to advance Unit 3, was again to borrow personnel from Unit 4. So we didn't really want to do that, but it was a necessary move to continue to advance the work at Unit 3. Now, as we finish that work, we will send those people back to Unit four. And once again, they will be de -linked. But for the period of time in which we have borrowed personnel from 4 to 3, a delay in 3 means a delay in 4. And so that has happened. The other thing that we have done is to augment back fills, sourcing efforts with our own efforts. We've had a very deep engineering and construction services group in Birmingham, our own resources that we could attract personnel and so we have significantly augmented Bechtel's efforts to increase the flow of people necessary to promote skilled labor, electricians and field supervisory personnel. All of those things are in progress. All of those things are consistent with the new schedules we've given you. And I will say one more thing. There was a lot of conversation about this. I can tell you, Chris Womack and I in particular, we're really watching the t rends. If I just looked at current data, we still have margin 6 weeks or so to Unit 3, 3 months or so to Unit 4 on the existing not extended schedules. We looked at the trends, however, and the trends to me we're troubling. And so we all kind of step back and said, I would rather take the conservative posture of evaluating these trends and adding more time, because frankly we didn't believe that we had 6 months of scheduled margin left on 3, and 3 months of scheduled margin left on 4. And we could've quibble on adding a month or 2 months. We said, let's go ahead and add a quarter for both. And that's where we came out on this decision."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. So it's not so much the 9 months necessarily. It's that you're adding a quarter of both of those latitude with in both schedule. If I'm hearing you right.
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Yeah. And this idea of there's got to be 12 months, they're in fact -- the only time they are linked is when we borrowed from 4 to 3. Therefore, a delay in 3 causes a delay in 4. Once we get 3 back into its place, then we are able to send the people back to 4 and again, they are de -linked. The 9 month difference between the 2 does not trouble us."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. Okay. I'll leave it there.  guys. Best of luck. Hear from me soon me.
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman . , Tom. Likewise. Dan, nice to have you CFO. So just first on the maybe Tom just on the Vogtle schedule. I kn ow you don't want to speak for staff the commission, but just with this latest update in the way that you're giving schedules now, is there a better chance that, they'll match up closer to what you are saying when they come out in a few weeks on this or should we be prepared for something that's again different than what you're saying."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman Clear that was very helpful. And Dan going back to the question before about trying to kind of size the potential equity needs or asset sale, target need. You said just look at the what's the cost increases have been is that it's a simple as that or are you targeting any different metrics as well? And then you had prior to that?"
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Drew Evans Yes. Look, Steve, if you want to make an assumption in your model that our opportunity to do that is the size of the after-tax write-offs, that's a reasonable assumption. That said, we're looking across multiple opportunities. We will see what that looks like. More importantly, from a long-term perspective, that uplift in the credit metrics that we talked about is really what is key. We always take a long-term view on this stuff and I'm very comfortable with how we're positioned long term and there's not a need for anything or significant than those near-term charges that we've taken to earn."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman No, I'm just -- you haven't given a number on what the DRIP equity that you said you turn the DRIP on. Did you --"
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning And you're in a prior call you kind of said was we thought the drip and one year without the last issue. This is another roughly $200 million. So let's see what the review of our asset sales are, and we'll figure out where we go on the issuance of new shares under the drip. Please assure if we can find a better solution than issuing shares under the drip will do it."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Fleishman Right. And I guess to degree that there might be some, incremental growth opportunities in the Capital plan as you go through IRP transition, etc., asset sales could help fund that part too."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Yes. I think good and as Dan indicated from -- if you look at the capex forecast, most likely the capex opportunity associated with the transition of the fleet will occur in the back part of that capex forecast."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Steve Fleishman Okay. Where our credit metrics will be [Indiscernible] Okay. .
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet Good,  for having me. Just wanted to come back to Vogtle. If I could here. Just wanted to see if you could provide some incremental color on labor market impacts here and just as I'm thinking, how much just costs go up per month delayed at this point, just this prior increased seems a bit larger then I would've thought."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Yes. And I would be remiss if we didn't had the idea that in sourcing all of these personnel in the skilled labor. Sean McGarvey and his team at the building trades has been fabulous. The IBEW in particular has been , they've given us tremendous ongoing support. And I think our relationship with them is really bearing fruit here as we augment that builds efforts."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet Got it, that's helpful.  for that. And maybe just shifting towards the DC for a minute here if I could. Obviously, things are fluid here, but just want to see as things stand right now, what are your biggest takeaways from the federal infrastructure legislation? And when thinking about minimum taxes, well, I guess how do you think some of the gives and takes as it relates to Southern?"
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Tom Fanning So don't have much of an impact us. I'm sure it would for others tha t rely on tax benefits to drive their earnings.
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Lapides Hey guys. I just wanna say, A.  for taking the question. B. Dan congratulations. Another kind of being talented person in the CFO seat and your large Company have always with lots going on and kudos well-deserved. Next year in Georgia, and I'm just trying to think about the regulatory calendar in the series of events and more, how they intertwine or if they intertwine. So you'll go through the IRP process. I forget if the IRP actually gets formal approval or not. But you've also -- I think still have a rate case. And then will you also file to get Unit 4 in service if it looks like similar to how you did with Unit 3 to go ahead and set what the revenue requirement would be."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning So Michael, there is a laundry list of things going on next year. We're certainly taking all of that into account. If you look at history. The Georgia Power Company with its relationship with the PSC itself, and what the work load at the staff, I think we've always managed to find our way to get big things done. And we just look forward to that constructive relationship going forward, I think the recent settlement agreement we reached on the stuff we just mentioned in the script was evidenced of that continued good working relationships. There is a lot going on next year with VCM, with IRP, with Vogtle 3, with potential prudency earnings beginning on the fuel load of 4 with a rate case filing. So there's a lot to work through. Just to understand that as we have in the past, we'll work with the folks involved to do it in the right way."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Lapides Got it. My other question and I saw a little news splash. For the past week or so about you're buying a plant from AI infrastructure private equity owner to serve. I think it was for Alabama Power. Just curious, when you look around do you see significant opportunities for kind of plant M&A to bring them into rate base versus going through the construction process?"
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Yes, we do. And we keep those things, just as we're talking about buying and selling and we want to kind of keep our kimono closed at this point, as we see those opportunities we'll certainly work on them. That's just another evidence of something. The other kind of good thing about buying used assets that way. As you think about transitioning the fleet, I think I've said this in the past, to get to 0 for us we're going to have a profile in the 2040 to 2050 that will look something like 50% renewables, maybe 20% nuclear, maybe 25% natural gas. A lot of that natural gas will have CCS on it. The tail end of that, the 5% remaining could be something different. It could be hydrogen, it could be a variety of other thing. Hydrogen doesn't appear to be all that viable until maybe in the 30s. You do know that the Plant Alabama is building has the capability to blend hydrogen into its fuel mix. So you may see hydrogen occur in an indirect sort of way prior to the 40s and 50. But anyway, my sense is that you're going to have a lot of opportunity to buy some natural gas. The good thing about buying used units is, they may have a remaining life of 10 to 15 years, that fits in with retirement schedules that are consistent with adding more renewables. So those assets look like bridging assets. and very attractive economically and important to our strategy of replacing it with renewables."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Flemont  so much. You've talked a little bit about that you still have construction work remaining on the plant. Can you give us a time-frame that it's going to take for you to complete the construction and if you want to sort of separate out the third bucket that you think you can do, after you get the letter. You can do it either with or without that bucket."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Paul, maybe I'm not following your question. Could you, try that again?"
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Flemont In terms of days or months, how much -- how much physical construction work do you have yet, remaining on Unit 3?"
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Okay. So in general, what I indicated was here we are in nearly the middle of November. Okay. So in order to hit January, 103G. So that's 2 months round numbers. Okay. And then I would say if we had 103G in hand in January. My best guess right now is there maybe another 6 weeks of construction. So let's just think about that, 2 months plus 6 weeks is 3.5 months. Okay. That's a broad estimate."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Hey, excuse me, Paul. And we certainly have allowed more time than that in the revised schedule. Remember, we added 3 months to all of that."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Paul Flemont Okay. So you believe you have 6 weeks of physical work still to go? And then --
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Flemont 2 months plus another either 6 weeks or 3 weeks, depending on where you are."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Drew Evans And Paul just stated a different way with our September assumption for in-service of third quarter. of 2022, then work could  continue through April with a 103G receipt fuel load in May, and then in-servicing system."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Flemont And then can you tell us where you are relative to turnover and testing? I think there were 159 systems for each of the plants that need to go through turnover and testing. I think the last update, you were roughly at 120 on Unit 3. But is there any update on where you are now on Unit 3 and Unit 4?"
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning So let's think about it. We have now completed -- so there was 158 walk-through to go through. We've completed them all now. Let's start there. We think there's about, let's see, 100,000 hours or so direct construction. We have in terms of systems, I forget how many we started with, but around 17 left to go. In between the July call and now, we turned over 11. And so it's interesting to look at is the symmetry of that even though I think we're probably closer. If in 3 months we turned over 11, 17 to go I just said 3 to 4 months, that's a little inaccurate because all the systems are being worked on and we're getting closer to complete all the systems. So there's probably a little bit less than that. In order to get to 103G. We need the completion of eight system turnovers. We have 7 to get to fuel load. So that's the delta between 103G and fuel load. And I said, that can expand and contract, how we think about that. Those seven are being Don and parallel, with the 8 required to get 100 3G. So those are not sequential, they are parallel. And then even after a fuel load, there are some things that will continue to be worked on. I think there's like two systems that you can do even after fuel load. So let me just say that again. Of the 17 systems that remain to turnover, 8 are required to get 103G, 7 are required to get to fuel load, 2 can be continued to be worked on even after fuel load."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Flemont So I'm gathering from what you're saying. In the past, I think you've needed to get all of your I-tax approved by the NRC before you get the 103G letter. I'm gathering here, are you guys asking for the NRC to give you different treatment where you would get the 103G letter before all of --"
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning No. This is all consistent with everything we've ever done with the NRC and 103 G, everything is consistent."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Flemont In other words, all the ITAAC s would need to be approved, but I would assume that not all, but you would still have systems that would be untested. So those are systems that don't require ITAAC approvals, I take it."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Yes. In order to get permission to load fuel, so the systems after permission to load fuel are not necessarily safety-related items. They could be somebody's signage issues or something like that. Anything that is required to get 103G is encapsulated in the eight systems I mentioned. Before, we load fuel, we still want to do 7, 2 of those -- not 2 of those in additional 2 can be done even after we load fuel. They're just not safety-related construction items."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning I'm sure you guys know Aaron Abramovitz. He was Chief Financial Officer of the project. He was actually located on-site. Now he's the CFO with Georgia Tower. In order to give you the schedule that you saw in your package, effectively what he did, he started with September in service date. We believe we have margin to that. But he started with September in-service. And then he reverse engineered back in a conservative way to say, well this would be the ITAAC completion schedule consistent with September. We believe we have margin to that. As we get ITAAC s filed in November, I'll go ahead and say we expect to get about 20. Well this one the schedule we gave you indicates nothing in November and not much work in December. When we think we'll have that exceeded by a pretty good margin. And so we'll be ahead of the schedule. Well, that just suggests our belief that in fact there is margin to the schedule we're giving you now. And the other thing Greg was important in that, the reason why we went to all this trouble was we thought you guys would want to have a way to measure our progress. And hitting 103G and ultimately fuel load and we thought this was kind of a good way to measure our progress. So look and see how many I've tax we file in November and December and compared to the schedule and I think you'll see that. I think we'll beat the schedule pretty handily at least early on for sure."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Flemont And then last question, where are you currently in the cost sharing, Dan, as it relates to you and your partners in the plant? Are you now at a point where you're picking up a 100% of the incremental project costs?"
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning But just very matter of fact, with  Paul as we disclosed our calculation to just we're not even into the first end for sure."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Sophie Karp I'm good.  for taking my questions. How are you?
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sophie Karp All right. Just a little quick one. Do you expect to have any kind of incremental labor issues as a result of the OSHA rule regarding the COVID vaccination mandate sort of kicks in. Fair to assume, I think and just any thoughts, I appreciate it given your way before this vaccination rates."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Yes, Ma'am. You know, we always have the health and safety of our employees foremost in our minds. And I think if you look at the way we've handled the site through the epidemic, I think it's been amazing. The accomplishments that those folks have done even under restricted protocols. We were just on a call here as we just gotten more granularity, I guess from OSHA, about what their expectations are. It's 400 pages long. We're kind of diving through it. We know there are legal challenges to come. It's really too early for us to say right now what we think the impacts will be. I know even EEI has requested a 90-day delay. Look, there's a lot to digest right now. Let's keep our eyes on that. And just as a final thought, you folks know that I've been leading the ESCC, electricity sub-sector coordinating counsel. And I know the deals are cyber and physical threats. It also deals with the industry's response to major storms. We call those national response events. And so I've kind of helped organize the national response to a hurricane or a snow storm, or what have you. Clearly as you introduce new operating requirements into those gigantic magnitude events, we got to make sure that we serve the interest of customers, and not only get the wires up and the plants running, but restore hope to the communities we're privileged to serve. We don't want to let any of these new requirements interfere with our ability to serve the American economy during those times. So all of those conversations are going on right now. And Sophie, I wish I could give you more granular stuff, but it's all just very timely conversation we're working through. I'm very confident by our next earnings call we'll have more to stay there."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sophie Karp Got it.  for the comments, I appreciate it. That's all for me."
4465705,The Southern Company,SO,11/4/2021,CEO Tom Fanning on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tom Fanning Hey, Paul.  to have you with us. Paul? We would still be  to have you with us. I don't know where he is. Mr. Patterson, your line is open. Please check your mute button or lift your handset. It appears we're unable to hear you. Please, you will register for your question. If y ou'd like to ask your question. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? Just to say . I'm I get frustrated at times. I know you guys may get frustrated also, this kind of scheduled stuff. But I think what we're doing right now is conservative imprudent. It gives us more margin. We're working very hard. We're making progress. We'll get there. And I want to thank the people at the site for working so hard and making the progress they're making with respect to the challenges of personnel, quality that always remains foremost. And this phrase we used, get it right, is so important to us, we will always work to get it right. So  for your for your understanding and all of that. As we move through these issues, we've had good progress. The regulatory constructs that we had on the first 2.1 billion at all, I think was more evidence that I think we do have a constructive working relationship. And that post Vogel, the numbers are essentially irrefutable I mean, I think that cash flow, earnings trajectory, overall financial integrity of the Company, is truly outstanding and we think warrants anyone's interest as an investment. So  for your time and we look forward to talking with you next week at EEI. Dan, any closing comments? No, sir. See everyone at EEI. All right. That's all, Operator.  very much. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company third quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Begleiter . . Seifi, you had a couple of –"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Begleiter . . You had a couple of delays in your projects, most notably NEOM and Indonesia by roughly a year. Can you just talk about why those projects are being pushed out by year?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi David, I wouldn't call them delays. I mean, these are mega projects. And we announced them to give our best judgment about them, they come on stream, but all of these projects need to be permitted. They need government approvals and all of that. So, each time we had a call to give you our latest estimate of what we think these projects can come on stream. So, right now, our best estimate for these projects are the days that we have given you. If we can move them forward, we will tell you. If there's further delays, we will let you know, because as I said, we cannot forecast everything, because we are dependent on getting significant permits for a lot of these projects."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Begleiter Understood. And just on the CapEx increase ex- Jazan, can you just talk about the pieces of that $5 million to build out increase? How much is maybe Alberta, how much is Louisiana, et cetera? ."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi Well, I'll bet on Louisiana I’m not going to consume a huge amount of capital next year. But it is all related to the projects that Dr. Serhan mentioned. I mean, people focus on our mega projects, and obviously, we are delighted to talk about it. But don't forget, we still have a base business, which is very resilient, and we are doing many, many, many projects. Actually, as Dr. Serhan mentioned, last year was a record year for our small and mid-sized projects. We are getting our fair share of the market on those projects, they are going away going to be executed, and they require capital."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John McNulty  for taking my question. So Seifi, with the huge spike in energy prices that you saw over in Europe, and I imagine maybe even a little bit in Asia as well. I guess, can you speak to how quickly you can offset it with regard to prices, something where look, you automatically kind of immediately put it all in? Or, is it something that has to ease in over the next few quarters? I guess, how should we be thinking about that?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi , John. John, as you know very well, we have two parts to our business, on the on-site, they immediately growing, because that's just pass-through. Our merchant side and packaged gases business, some of it as clauses, but a lot of it don't have clauses. And therefore, we need to go and increase prices and invoice the customers and convince them that energy prices have gone up. And then there is a competitive environment. Some people have tried to use this as an excuse to get market share and all that. So we need work to do. But what has compounded our issue in terms of being able to recover them fast enough is that the rate of energy increases. I mean, if energy increases, we do forecast of these things. But what happened in Europe, in the month of August and September, was something that it was impossible to forecast that things would go up to 100%. So as a result, we’re lagging in terms of price increases in our merchant business, especially in Europe, but the team is doing a fantastic job. They did a  job in September and October, but there is more work to be done. So we will be delayed about a quarter maybe."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John McNulty Got it. So a quarter to kind of catch up on that. Okay. And then, I guess when thinking about your margin target where you expect to get the margins back up to kind of that 40% range, give or take, admitting that the rest of it really is more energy pass-through and isn't really a reflection of the business. I guess, can you speak to the timing of when you think you can get there? Is it something where we can kind of see the margins approaching that type of a level by the end of 2022? Is it going to take longer than that? I guess, and what are some of the measures that you really have to kind of enact in order to get back to those 40% type level?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi John, as far as I'm concerned, I like to see those margins back then, next time we talk in January. I mean, we don't like to see our margins go down. Therefore, the pricing actions that we put in place has a lot to do with that, because it's all about that -- the margins are all about pricing. The volumes are the volumes. The margin is how much profit you made per unit of volume. So we need to catch up with the energy costs. And our g oal is to catch up with it as soon as possible. So, then you say my target is to be able to report that our margins have gone back up to 40% by next quarter or the quarter after that. How much of it be achieved is obviously going to depend on the efforts of all of us over here, but we are doing our best to get there as soon as we c an. And we are also increasing book for that spirit, absolutely."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,John McNulty Got it.  very much for the color. Appreciate it.
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin McCarthy Yes, , Seifi. Just to follow-up on the previous question, can you talk about the level of price increases that you're seeking today in various regions to keep up with this energy inflation? And do you think that pace of realization could differ versus history?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi , Kevin. What it means is that, obviously, the pace of price increases you have seen what we have done in the past, it's about 18th, 19th consecutive quarters that we're getting -- for our merchant business, we are getting 3%, 4%, 5% price increases in different regions around the world. So now, before we begin increasing prices to improve our margins, now we have to increase prices to maintain our margins. And therefore, there is a significant sense of urgency on that. And how successful we are, we are going to report that to you next quarter. I don't want to forecast that, because there is a lot of activities that we do and a lot involved. But the fact is that energy prices have gone up. And we need to recover that by increasing prices. Everybody needs to do that. And there is global inflation. And if people can deal with that, they are going to see their margins go down. And at the same time, we need to also continue to work on our productivity goals. And our people know that, and we are all very focused on that, Kevin."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin McCarthy  for that. And Seifi, I wanted to ask your opinion on a high level question related to clean hydrogen. One can look at this business and recognize it's got vastly different growth potential than, say atmospheric gases and different capital requirements, different technology, discrete assets, et cetera. And you could look at multiples for, let's say, lithium producers or other high growth businesses, and they're quite high today. And so, that might argue for separating the business at some point in time. On the other hand, you've got a lot of benefits of integration, including inexpensive costs of capital and a high quality balance sheet. So, as you consider all of those things, how do you think about how the business might develop over time, and whether or not will remain within the portfolio on an integrated basis for the long-term?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi Kevin, you are asking me a very intelligent question. And my answer to that is that our commitment is to create value for our shareholders. If, at some point in time, what you are suggesting is a significant opportunity for significantly increasing shareholder value, we would obviously consider that. But I don't want to give the impression that we want to do anything tomorrow. And besides that, we need to kind of demonstrate the success of the hydrogen business and all of that. So the question that you're asking is a very . And we, as a company, as a board, always look at those options. Now, when we would act or if the act on it, it depends on the circumstances, depends on the market, depends on the development of the hydrogen business, and all of that. So, sorry to give you a general answer, Kevin, but I'm sure you appreciate what I'm saying."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin McCarthy I do, and sorry for putting you on the spot there. But, certainly welcome those thoughts. Much appreciated."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Byrne Yes, . Just wanted to drill into your guidance a little bit. If I understood it correctly, and Jazan is in the 2022 guide, if you back out that 11-months' worth, it seems like kind of a mid-single digit EPS guide. Is there anything that you are expecting that is a particular headwind in the year? Or, are you just being conservative here?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi Steve, first of all, , and  for your question. I'm very happy that you're breaking it down the way that you are breaking it down. We are showing that, first of all, I think we should get credit for Jazan. At the end of the day, that's part of the company and we're increasing the EPS 15%. But if you want to look at this asset by saying, okay, I know you have done that, but the base business looks like is growing 6%. Well, that is the baby seat award right now, because the base business, Kevin, as you know better than I do, is dependent on the growth of GDP or industrial production. And I'm not sitting here getting too excited about prospects of GDP or industrial production growth anywhere in the world. I mean, everybody likes to say that COVID is over now everything is growth. China, the biggest growth engine that the world had last quarter grew only 3%. Europe, GDP and industrial production is not going anywhere. In the U.S., not that much happening. And Latin America is not going anywhere. So I think between the  circumstances, and then considering all of the issues about energy costs, and then -- that we need to recover all of the issues that is related to supply chain, which is affecting our ability to move helium containers around the world, that's a real issue. And then all of the fundamental supply chain that I mentioned, and the ove rall economic activity, these are all real issues. Our job is to give you a guidance that is reasonable. We gave you a guidance for fiscal year 2021, the average of that was 902.5, and we delivered 902, despite the hurricanes, which we didn't forecast, despite the power outages and all of that. It's our job to have a balance. We know the business very well. It's our job to look at growth things, look at the other things and put it all together and give you the best judgment that we have at the time to give it to you. And right now, our best judgment is that yeah, you're right, that overall our base business is going to grow about 6% or 7%. I hope it does better. But we are responsible for giving you a responsible forecast, rather than daydreaming about the fact that everything will be fine. And COVID hasn't gone away either. So, sorry to give you a long answer. But, I hope that helps."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Byrne It does. , Seifi. And I did want to ask you a question about your blue hydrogen outlook. When we drill into the Alberta and Louisiana projects, it seems to us that a majority of the capital is really to produce incremental hydrogen supply more so than it is for carbon sequestration or capture. And if that's a fair assumption, what in your view is the key driver for that outlook for needing incremental hydrogen supply in these regions? And is it driven by renewable fuel?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi Kevin, there is two fundamental dynamics. We are talking here about 2020, the time that – yes, 2026 when these projects are going to come on stream. Number one, we do need increase hydrogen demand on the pipeline, because we have new customers that are coming on. And foresee ourselves sold out on that and therefore we need additional hydrogen and the pipeline. The second thing is that we think there will be significant additional customers if you can give them blue hydrogen, and they will convert and get the benefits. But then a significant part of their production, especially in Canada is going to be liquid, which is going to go for mobility where we see people converting to hydrogen for their mobility and the program they have. Then in Louisiana, the massive amount of hydrogen that we are making, a significant part of that or part of that we haven't given you the details until we figured out all of the details, but fundamentally, a significant amount will be converted to blue ammonia, which will be exported. And you know where the destination of that export is, that's basically in Japan, where they have no other choice. But how is Japan going to decarbonize? They don't have oil, they don't have gas, they don't have nuclear. And they don't have shallow waters to do any kind of wind mills offshore. So they need to import their energy. And the best form of energy to import is import blue ammonia, that the co2 has been captured, and to burn it in their power plants to generate electricity, so that then they can use that electricity to drive their cars and all. So, that is the thinking that we have in terms of the outlet for the blue hydrogen."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Duffy Fischer Dr. Serhan talked about 2021 being a record year for the investment kind of in that mid-size CapEx for you guys. So when we look at that, roughly how accretive is that to ‘22 and ‘23 going forward? Is that significantly a bigger jump than normal? Or how should we figure that into our model?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi Well, it seems to be accretive as we go forward. I mean, all of those projects that he's talking about take two or three years to build. So if ’21, we got the project, so it will be ’22, ‘23, it starts having an impact on our results in ’24, ‘25. Those things are not that something that you turn it on right away. They still need to be engineered and built. But he's absolutely correct that we had a very good year on those mid-size projects. We don't usually talk about that, but we decided to talk about it this quarter, because I was just getting concerned that people are under the impression that the only thing they like is mega projects. No, we are committed to our existing business. And we are getting more than our fair share of the existing business on the smaller size. And our people are doing a  job in getting those projects and executing them."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Duffy Fischer Okay. Fair enough. And then, Seifi you had made a comment that there was some disruption in your business in China in particular. Was that power being cut off to your plants? Was that power being cut off to your customers where they couldn't run? Can you break down out a little bit more, how were you impacted where you had to shut down your operations there?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi First of all -- and let me just characterize it, those disruptions in the fourth quarter was not material. They weren't that much. We felt obligated to mention them because there were a few incidents, but they were not material. Now, are they going to be material in this quarter or the next quarter? We have to wait and see. And then the other thing is that we have two kinds of business, as you very well know. We have the on-site business, the on-site business we did only shut down our plant if the customer is forced to shut down. Let's say, it’s a steel plant, and they say shut down the steel plant, the customer doesn't need t he oxygen, they have to shut down the power plant. Then we have our merchant business, our merchant business, we rarely every shut down our merchant business, because we are not a dirty business. So they don't specifically say shut down the ASU. It's mainly the customers that they shut down, which affects us."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Marc Bianchi Hi. . I wanted to first start with the blue hydrogen projects that you have announced and using the technologies of ATR and POCs. And I think you commented earlier that there's a competitive advantage of gasification that's at play there. I was hoping if you could talk about that a little bit more, especially after we've heard from peers saying that they too can offer both technologies and even capture 95% of the co2 through SMR?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi Marc, I'm very happy that you're asking me the question. Because, the blue hydrogen projects that we have announced, we are using new technology in Canada and another technology in Louisiana, when we can capture 95% of the co2 and sequestrating. When it comes to the SMR, what happens in SMR? When you take the natural gas, you have a steam methane reformer. You take some of the natural gas directly into the process, goes over a catalyst, and you break down CH4 to CO on hydrogen, and then you shift, it you have hydrogen and CO becomes CO2, and it goes up at the atmosphere. You can capture 95% of that, true. But then you use a lot of the natural gas to burn to heat up the tubes, which contain the catalyst, that is combustion, like a combustion in a furnace, or in a power plant. Theoretically, you can capture that CO2, but it will cost you an arm and a leg to capture that. So, making a statement that I can capture 95% of the CO2 from SMR, sure, you can capture the CO2 is air too. But the issue is that is it cost effective or not. So what we are saying is that the technology that we have makes it possible to capture the CO2 in a cost effective way. But, yeah, you have to put a lot of equipment on the SMR to capture the CO2 from combustion. Theoretically, you can say, yeah, I can put a special boxes and do that. And I really don't want to comment on what our competitors say, they have to defend what they say, it's their business. But from our point of view, when we put carbon capture on SMRs, as we have done, and we actually operate the biggest plant in Port Arthur, everybody can go and take a look at it. We have the CO2 capture on the process spot, because that is economical, we can capture that and use it for the natural recovery. But on the combustion part, we don't do that, because that becomes cost prohibitive. Can it be done? Yeah, sure, anything can be done at the cost. I hope that helps, Marc."

Just curious, is there a scenario where Lu’An could return to full fees before ‘23? And then, I guess on the other hand, what is the likelihood that that production could become permitted?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi I understood the first part of your question, and that thing is that the agreement that we have -- the plant is running at full capacity. The agreement we have with them in terms of structure of the fees and so on that is not going to improve in 2022  versus what we have right now. It will improve in 2023. The second part of your question, I wasn't sure I heard it, because you got this -- there was a disruption on what you said. Can you just repeat the second part?"

4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vincent Andrews I'm very well. , Seifi. I'd be curious to get your thoughts on in the long-term, not obviously, where things are today. But, if you think in the medium to long-term, what you think the cost of carbon is going to be? And maybe on a regional basis, you could talk about it. And to the extent you want to discuss what you're assuming when you think about looking at a new project that might be helpful too?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi Vincent, you're asking a very, very insightful question. I mean, right now, different parts of the world have put different numbers in place. I mean, in California, they have put $200 per ton of CO2, you get an incentive for that. Canada is talking about $50 to $100 per ton. Other parts of the world that we have exposure to that, if the number is somewhere between $100, $50, $75, $150, it's all over the place. I think that the way we look at these projects, and all of that, we try to kind of look at the profitability, on the basis that we don't get too much of these kinds of things, because we don't want to rely on governments of subsidies every time to do something. But overall, these numbers are all going to develop based on the commitments that people have made. And fundamentally, what is going to happen, Vincent, if people are going to -- I see that a  deal of fascination, all of these promises being made at Glasgow. But if you add up all of those things, the amount of carbon credits that you need in order to meet the requirements becomes gigantic. And therefore, in order to generate those things, customers need to start using these low carbon energy sources. And therefore, you have to have real incentives for people to convert from diesel, for ships and trains, and planes, and all of that, and steelmaking to really shift to clean energy. And that one, a little bit of incentive is not going to do that. So, I think if the governments are serious to achieving those goals, they have to put in steep incentives to incentivize people to actually do that. So, the prospect of that is very encouraging for our business, but we have to see how it develops, Vincent, as we go forward."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vincent Andrews I appreciate that answer. And, yes,  very much. In the interest of time, I'll pass it along."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Zekauskas  very much. Seifi, I was looking at your project commitments, and I didn't see any commitments in the electronics area through 2026. Is that something strategic where Air Products is moving away from the electronics area in favor of other opportunities? And when you look at your $4.5 billion or so in CapEx for next year, can you talk about what the big chunks that you're going to spend?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi Jeff, , first of all. Jeff, one of the reasons that we wanted Dr. Serhan to talk about smaller facilities and all of that, was because my concern about the fact that the question that you just asked, we are winning our fair share of business in electronics, we are doing some very big projects for people like all of these big electronic manufacturers, like Intel, like Samsung, like TSMC, and all of that. You don't see it, you don't highlight them, because they are not mega projects, but we are getting our fair share of those. So, we are not -- that is actually one of the sectors we are very focused on. We are very strong in Asia Pacific, where most of these projects are happening. And we are definitely on top of that. Now, in terms of the breakdown, I've been hesitant to give you the breakdown, because then people know exactly which projects we projects we have involved, and all of that. But believe me, Air Products has been and continues to be extremely focused on the electronics sector. And I can claim that we are definitely winning our fair share of those projects for those big cust omers."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"PJ. Juvekar Yes. . Seifi, I’ll ask one quick question. What's happening globally, we look at the narrative about COP26 in a move towards decarburization, and less investments in fossil fuels. Do you see a scenario where fossil fuel prices just keep going up as a result, similar to what has happened in Europe? And if that does happen, hypothetically, how do your projects in China and other parts of the world fare in an environment of higher energy prices? ."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi Well, PJ,  very much for asking a very excellent question. The thing is that there is no question that if hydrocarbon prices go up, like the oil price having gone up, that does help some of the existing projects that we have in China. I mean, right now, one of the reasons that Lu’An is operating at full capacity, despite the very high price of coal in China is because -- what are they doing, they are taking coal, and they are making diesel. And they are selling the diesel fuel at higher prices, because the oil price is $84 a barrel. So in a roundabout way, if hydrocarbon costs go up, it helps those kind of projects. But then the other interesting part is that if hydrocarbon costs go up, then the cost of renewable energy compared to hydrocarbons becomes even more attractive. So you would say that it's easier to convert a truck driver from diesel to hydrogen, because now the diesel is costing more. So in a funny way, if actually hydrocarbon prices go up, it will help our strategy in terms of focusing on renewables. Does that make sense, PJ?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"PJ. Juvekar Yes, that does. But does it impact your coal gasification plants?"
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi But it helps them, because the coal gasification plants are producing chemicals, which are competing the production from oil. I mean, the whole reason that China is using a lot of coal, or Indonesia wants use a lot of coal or India wants to use coal is because they want to use coal to produce chemicals, so that they don't have to pay foreign currency for the oil that they import. So, if energy prices go up, coal prices are in the ground, therefore that would help."
4465706,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",APD,11/4/2021,CEO Seifi Ghasemi on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Seifi Ghasemi  very much. I really appreciate that. Any other questions or that’s -- It appears there are no further questions at this time. Okay. With that, then I would like to thank everybody who was on the call. We very much appreciate your very good and insightful and sometimes difficult questions, but that's the way it is. We do appreciate that.

You guys mentioned a few updates on the call, specifically kind of on the algorithm side and trying to make progress on O5. So, I was curious what kind of pivotal study that -- what that pivotal study could look like. And then, as you think about the types of patients that could benefit from Omnipod and O5 specifically, would it be intensely managed, or could you actually kind of accelerate some of the efforts into other types of type 2s and why?"
4465737,Insulet Corporation,PODD,11/5/2021,CEO Shacey Petrovic on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robbie Marcus Wayde, I wanted to ask on U.S. and international Omnipod for fourth quarter. And I was hoping you could just sort of walk us through some of the puts and takes here. It looks like in the international market that the midpoint of the guide is down sequentially on a dollar basis. So, just wondering what would drive that. Are people using less Pods? I would imagine with the annuity model, if utilization was the same, it’d probably increase. And then, also, in the U.S., you’re still seeing record new patient starts. So, I was just sort of wondering what brought you down off the top end of the guidance range there, and walk us through some of the dynamics there. ."

Just trying to push a little bit, make sure this isn’t going to slip again. So, just curious, what gives you the confidence? Are we just waiting now for FDA, or have you had more back -- is there still more back and forth happening with FDA? And then, I have one quick follow-up."

So, just as you -- as it relates to the Omnipod 5 launch as well, I’m curious if you guys think about what learning -- what you could learn early on in the launch, or do you think launching an integrated system is not going to be all that different from sort of how you’ve launched the Omnipod in the past? Just curious if there’s anything different about launching an integrated system versus launching just a standard Omnipod. And should we be thinking about this launch differently than sort of how you’ve been present in the market in the past? And that’s it for me."
4465737,Insulet Corporation,PODD,11/5/2021,CEO Shacey Petrovic on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Lawrence Biegelsen Just, Shacey, one big-picture question on international. We’ve seen it slow the last couple of years and the midpoint of the guidance is 13% this year. How should we think about international growth before Omnipod 5 launches outside the U.S.? And any color on whether that could st art happening in 2022, or should we be thinking about international Omnipod 5 launch as more like 2023?"
4465737,Insulet Corporation,PODD,11/5/2021,CEO Shacey Petrovic on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Johnson Wayde, you’ve mentioned the competitive impact of AID systems a couple of times. Every time you do, it seems like it’s focused on the international market. So one, we’ve got at least one of those AID systems here in the U.S., you’re not mentioning it as much from a U.S. perspective. Is that just given the pharmacy access, the t2 access, things like that that’s covering that up, or is there something specific in the international markets relative to the U.S. that is causing some of that issue, number one? And number two, Shacey, just to push on that OUS O5 time line and commentary you had. Regulatory-wise, what would you have to do? Can you use U.S. pivotal data to get a CE Mark and launch in Europe, maybe in Canada, things like that, or would you have to go through trials there that you haven’t yet contemplated or started? ."
4465737,Insulet Corporation,PODD,11/5/2021,CEO Shacey Petrovic on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matt Taylor So, I just want to ask one about international, just as a educational question. I mean, you talk a lot about pharmacy and pay-as-you-go in the U.S. And I just wanted to characterize how much of those types of channel and trialing advantages were translatable in the international markets, given they’re heterogeneous and you have a different go-to-market strategy there. Could you talk a little bit about that?"
4465737,Insulet Corporation,PODD,11/5/2021,CEO Shacey Petrovic on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Travis Steed Just curious, Wayde, if you could give a little more color on kind of what you’re seeing with COVID vacations. And are you seeing staffing issues at ENDO offices? And a little color on kind of how you see some of the puts and takes on 2022? Obviously, Omnipod 5 is a big unknown at this point when that actually comes. But, just curious if you could give some puts and takes on next year, especial ly given some of the unusual seasonality we saw this year with COVID."

So, I have a couple of pharmacy questions. Pharmacy access, it’s now near 50% of your U.S. volume. Can we assume that the majority of these folks will have access to Omnipod 5 upon launch? And then, my second question is for the other half of folks that are not accessing Omnipod through the pharmacy, it looks like two-thirds may have coverage but are not yet going through the pharmacy. I’m just wondering, why are those folks not choosing to go throug h what seems like a better access point?"

Just a quick update on DTC, continuing to see the TV ads, and so just wondering if there’s any update on return on investment there on DTC? And what are the plans as you get into O5? And then, just on supply chain constraints, as we look into 2022, do you see any potential impacts to the working capital cycle as we get into next year?"

Obviously, your U.S. business is growing 20% plus the last couple of years, even despite the pandemic in here that should fade a bit next year and then definitely some room on DASH penetration and, obviously, the O5 launch at some point next year. So, is the 15% to 20% really a function of your U.S. business more towards the higher end of that range and OUS more towards the lower, or is that more a function of your expecting that ramp of O5 to not kick off in a meaningful way to the business until more later in the year?"
4465737,Insulet Corporation,PODD,11/5/2021,CEO Shacey Petrovic on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bret Christensen Yes. Well said, Wayde. Drew, I would just say, your question is right. It really is a stronger U.S. growth next year that’s really driven by the current growth drivers. So, DTC, our type 2 access, the pharmacy model, all those things will continue to drive the U.S. growth. We did build in some growth for Omnipod 5, as Wayde suggested. But again, with the annuity model, it takes a little bit of time. So, there’s still some uncertainty of the length of the LMR, the time to get to full market release. And then, once we get to full market release, the annuity model doesn’t really represent growth right away. It takes some time to build that into the rates and revenue. . I show our last question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead."
4465737,Insulet Corporation,PODD,11/5/2021,CEO Shacey Petrovic on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joanne Wuensch  so much for squeezing me in. I really appreciate it. I’m trying to get my head around something, which is when Omnipod 5 comes out, what does it do in terms of the portion of the market that you’re most likely to address? And so, what I’m also trying to do is cross-reference that with increasing new patient starts in type 2. Do you see your market splintering? Maybe splintering is a wrong word, or expanding? Or just help me understand when it arrives and as it arrives, what happens?"
4465737,Insulet Corporation,PODD,11/5/2021,CEO Shacey Petrovic on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bret Christensen Yes. I think, those 2 percentages that we often speak to 80% of our new starts coming from MDI and 40% of our new starts being type 2, I think we’re okay with those percentages going down with the introduction of Omnipod 5, as long as new starts go up, which they will for sure. The other thing to think about, Joanne, as you know, all these tailwinds that we’ve spoken about, that Shacey mentioned, are still going to be there with Omnipod 5, and we remove really one of the biggest headwinds that we have today, which is AID competition. So, Omnipod 5 does check all the boxes. It’s why we think it’s going to be a best-in-class product offering. And we’re so excited about what it does to grow once we get to full market release. . That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back over to Shacey Petrovic for closing remarks. Please go ahead. , Dalam. And , everyone, for your participation and questions today. As part of a company-wide event last week, we hosted several Omnipod users, including a few Omnipod 5 trial participants still using the system. And it was incredible to hear the impact Omnipod 5 has had on this diverse group of customers. Dwight, a grandfather living with late onset type 1 diabetes, said that because of Omnipod 5’s simplicity, he truly trusted the system right away when he walked out of the clinic. Morgan, a young woman living with type 1 diabetes for 19 years, told us, \""Omnipod 5 is magic. It’s unreal. I don’t ever have to think about my diabetes. I want everyone to know about it. It has changed  my life.\"" And Valentino, a first generation American who has participated in other AID system trials said of Omnipod 5, \""All I can say is wow. I’m waking up normal. I don’t ever have to think about my diabetes. It brings peace.\"" So, I want Dwight, Morgan, Valentino and others in the community to know that we hear you. We are working hard to get Omnipod 5 into your hands and to make sure that everybody knows about and can benefit from this remarkable technology.  again for joining us today. And have a  evening. . This concludes today’s conference call.  for your participation. And have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect."
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Philip Shen Hi, everyone.  for taking my questions. I have three groups of questions. The first one is around bookings and pricing. I was wondering, if you could provide a little bit more color on that. Looking ahead do you expect to accelerate or perhaps slow down bookings to maximize price? And then are you looking to make any changes to the way you structure your contracts, so you can maximize your pricing? Number two here, as it relates to the reconciliation bill, you have the $0.04 per watt thin film sell credit but then there's also the $0.07 module credit for the manufacturing production tax credit. Can you talk about -- do you think you get both added together, or do you think one or the other? And then finally as it relates to capacity expansion maybe talk to us about how you're thinking about it? And do you need that reconciliation bill before you guys  think about the next leg of capacity in Ohio or elsewhere in the US and what conditions in general you think you might need to announce another capacity expansion?  guys."
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Hey, .  for the time, guys. Appreciate it. So just to follow up on Phil's questions. First off, just looking at the year, the guidance, just confidence on shipments in 4Q? I know you said there was some already slipping from 3Q to 4Q. But just what are you seeing in port congestion, just the ability to deliver all together. I'll leave it open-ended. I know there's a lot of different pieces there, but clearly you're saying you've got some amount of visibility and confidence there. And then separately, I'll throw them all together here for ease of just going on the list. Coming back to the ability to qualify for certain subsidies here, how are you thinking about PLI in India, just as far as that goes in qualifying specifically for your expansion? And then lastly, any commentary on pricing, specifically on 2023. Again, I know that you just asked a little bit on maximizing it, but just aggregate level how much -- what trends are we seeing here on 2023 and especially 2024, as you start to see some of this backfilled and poten tially contemplate ITC, et cetera?"
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Alex Bradley Yeah. The other thing I'd add just on that is its pricing and also risk terms. So there is a view of changing risk profile around sales rate for instance that we're looking at in 2023 relative to historical contracts. So may not necessarily influence the overall ASP but does change the risk shift especially in the market we're seeing sales rate being a higher cost today.
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Julien Dumoulin-Smith You said you're getting a premium ASP for your risk or you're not recognizing a premium for your risk factors?
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mark Widmar So, if you think of it this way. I mean look freight cost right now is up 70%, 80%, 90%. And so we've kind of created a level of which we're willing to accept but a high percentage of that will now be passed through directly to our customers versus us sharing or carrying that entire risk on our ledger."
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Julien Dumoulin-Smith Excellent.  to hear that. Congrats again. Speak soon.
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"J.B. Lowe My question was on given all the moving parts we have between what you have booked for 2022, the ASPs that you have already locked in and kind of the moving pieces of costs that we have flowing through at this point shipping and otherwise, how do you think gross margin per watt should trend in 2022 versus 2021?"
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Alex Bradley So, if you look through the various moving pieces across the year, so Mark in his prepared remarks mentioned that there'll be some impact from our timing around CuRe. There'll be some specific impact related to that timing. We also will see some impact from overall cost per watt. So, the factory upgrades not only impact CuRe, but impact overall cost per watt. Without them we have less watts. Therefore, we have less amortization of fixed costs going across the capacity we have. We've seen commodity price pressures. So, I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about our year-over-year cost watt produced being down about 5% versus our previous expectation of 9%. That's mostly bill of materials issues. On the long-term, we believe that gets resolved but we do see short-term pressure especially on the aluminum side. From a sales rate perspective, I would say that you're going to see the run rate you're seeing in the second half of this year most likely carry forward into next year. So, no sequential increase forecast today, but higher relative to pre-pandemic levels. If you look in 2022 overall as well, it's going to be the first year we don't have the US Systems business, although we will have some contribution from Japan on a company-wide gross margin level you're going to see some impact of that. And then I'd say the other piece you're going to see is the flip side of not having that US Systems business the strategic decision we made to exit was accompanied by a growth decision and you're going to see that come through later. But in 2022, we haven't yet got additional capacity in the US or in India online, but you are going to see the costs associated with that in terms of startup and ramp costs coming through. We talked on the last call about that being somewhere in the range of $60 million to $70 million per factory combined start-up and ramp and you'd see I think a little bit more than half of that total coming through in 2022 with the remainder coming in 2023. So, you're going to see some pressure on -- across the board in 2022. What I would say is if you then look forward and take that through into 2023, most of those short-term challenges don't tell the longer-term story. So, the CuRe delay that we talked about that impact will be felt from 2022 not in 2023. By 2023, you'll have over half of the ramp and start-up for the India and the US factory, which will have been spent sequentially year-on-year. Going 2022 to 2023, you're going to see a decrease in startup and ramp. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, ASPs right now we're seeing 2022 to 2023 are essentially flat in the backlog. And at the time when we have got pretty strong macro tailwinds right now on the bookings. We would expect sea cost per watt come down over the two years. From a volume produced and sold perspective, you're going to see volume come up as the factories come online in 2023. You're also going to see Series 7 come through. Right now we're not booking for that. As we mentioned on our last call, we expect to see about a $0.01 to $0.03 gross margin entitlement advantage associated with Series 7 relative to Series 6 and that's a benefit split across ASP cost per watt in sales rate. And then lastly on the sales rate side, you're going to see a benefit again in 2023 relative to 2022. I just talked about the contractual shift that we're making whereby we are capping effectively the amount of sales risk we take and the passing remainder through to customers. So, you are going to see that by virtue of a lot of those things an impact to gross margin in 2022 a lot of which will reverse out in 2023 and we'll give you more clarity and visibility into that when we give guidance in February."
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"J.B. Lowe Awesome. . My other question was just on -- given all the pricing headwinds we've seen or cost headwinds we've seen, is there any change to the outlook for CapEx required to build the new facilities or timing of such?"
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mark Widmar Yeah. So look, there's a lot of moving pieces in the CapEx right now for both of the factories and some positive and some challenging, right? And one of the unfortunate reality of sales rate or freight in general I should say, carries itself all the way through our too l set and delivering of those tool sets to our factories, right? So we are seeing some higher costs there. We've seen some other benefits relative to our original assumptions around the equipment cost that are more favorable. So, as we review, which we do every month the status of those two expansions and then the relative CapEx relative to the goals and also what we committed externally. The numbers are still lining up. The thing that could impact schedule per se would be long delayed in transit delivery schedule of the equipment set. And so we are trying to get ahead of that and we're trying to move that forward. And we've accommodated for some longer in-transit delivery times. But everything we see as of right now, we're still on target basically within the budget which we've communicated externally as well as the schedule when those factories will be up and operational."
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ben Kallo . So if we did have the -- I don't know if we call it an as of manufacturing credit, but if we had that how do you guys monetize that is my first question. Can you use that yourself, or do you get a tax equity partner or how does that work? And then, how big do we think that is?"
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mark Widmar So first off, the way it's been structured right now, Ben, it's a refundable tax credit. So we don't have to have sufficient tax capacity to monetize it. To the extent we do have a tax liability then the credit would have offset that portion. And to the extent the credit was in excess of our tax liability then it would be a refundable credit that would be paid back to us by the US government. Ben, it's -- you can do the math, right? And the numbers can be pretty significant at $0.11 a watt. I mean you take $0.11 a watt across our US capacity, call it, three gigawatts for the US without the expansion. And then with the expansion you had another 3.3 gigawatts. So we're a little bit north of 6 gigawatts, in the way that it would work right now again with the module and the cell being additive, then you would be entitled to $0.11 for every watt of which we ship to produce and ship after beginning, let's say, it this way beginning January 1, 2022. So anything that we're producing right now would not be eligible for that even though it would potentially ship next year. But anything that we produce next year and ship then we would be entitled to a credit that as it currently is positioned would be a minimum of $0.11 a watt."
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ben Kallo Got it. And then, just with the uncertainty with this not shipping costs and financing costs and everything else. But how are customers -- I get this question a lot like how much stuff gets pushed out to next year to wait and see or what have you? And , guys."
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Mark Widmar So the one issue with us is that we're not seeing a lot of stuff moving. And the -- what's happening right now is unfortunately -- obviously not all of our customers are 100%. There are a couple which I do thank them very much. So the fact they're 100% committed to First Solar's technology but not all of them are. And they're getting reneged on or pushed out by our competitors. And so in some cases if they have a commitment with us on the books and the project discretely which that was associated with may be moving they're looking to take that volume and allocate it to another project that they're unable to get module supply for. So for us it's not much of an impact because nobody wants to give up the opportunity that they've got secured right now with us. And so what they're doing is taking delivery of modules and then using them in other projects. So I know others are seeing that impact. I know projects truly are slipping or getting pushed out. We're just not seeing much of that impact yet.
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Maheep Mandloi Hi.  for taking my questions. Just on the Japan project could you just talk about how much of EPS sensitivity do you expect from that? And just in terms of certainty what are you thinking about it? And could you just also talk more about the CuRe delay and improvements and how much the impact there is? I think you spoke about $100 million previously. Just wanted to clarify that for 2022. .
4465749,"First Solar, Inc.",FSLR,11/5/2021,CEO Mark Widmar on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mark Widmar Yes. As it relates to CuRe. So where we are with CuRe right now again there's two challenges, right? And one is our ability and the timing to replicate. We were in the process of upgrading our factories Malaysia, Vietnam to enable the CuRe production process which there are certain tools the oven in particular that has to be upgraded. And we have not been able to do that with the restrictions that have been placed on us because of the COVID pandemic and the Delta variant spread in the way that it has over the last several months things are getting better. So that's obviously all positive. But that's been a huge constraint and that delays our ability to roll out. Now before that even as we sit with where the solution development phase is right now we are behind where we want to be as it relates to -- if you think about the attributes of CuRe what's the value of CuRe? Well first and foremost is the improved long-term degradation rate. The other is higher efficiency. And then finally, it's the better temperature coefficient. So we've actually closed the gap between our existing product and the CuRe  degradation rate which we highlighted on the call that now we're at a 0.3 annual degradation rate based off of the studies that we've done and further validation with third-party methodologies that we're at 0.3 and we'll go forward with 0.3 right now but that's still higher than our 0.2. It's best-in-class industry, but not to the level that CuRe was going to take us to. The efficiency, at least as we exit this year we're recovered about two bins on efficiency with our existing products. So we've closed a little bit of that gap, but we're slightly off on efficiency from where we want to be. And then, on the temperature coefficient, so we are -- the temperature coefficient is not as favorable with our existing product is where we want to be with CuRe. Now we've been able to validate through our laboratory work as well as individually each one of those attributes through our pilot line. But when we take it into high-volume manufacturing there are certain attributes that are becoming more challenging as we try to take it into high-volume manufacturing. One is the handling of the product. So the -- I would say the film is not as resilient yet, as our current device is and therefore handling becomes much more of a concern. So we've  got to work through that, two ways. One is to improve potentially how we handle the product in the production process the other is, to make the film a little bit more resilient to enable that to happen. The other is it is currently the atmosphere and the effects of humidity in particular is a little bit more challenging than what we have with our existing products. So we've got to work through that. So we know we can solve each one of those. It's just a matter of time and to do it in high-volume manufacturing. And that means we're going to have to run. And so that's part of it. We've been doing runs. And we've been doing designs of experiments to validate and learn and evolve. So it's a matter of finalizing that effort. It's not an issue with the viability of the technology, as we've seen demonstrated either through the laboratory work or even the pilot line or we call it a quip line validation of those discrete attributes that we need in order to get to the program objectives for CuRe. And so we're working through each and every one of those. And our current view is right now we'll have our lead lineup and running by the end of Q1 of 2022. And then from there, once we have that validated then we'll make a decision on the replication throughout the balance of the fleet as well as the – hopefully, we're seeing some positive signs of ability to travel and to get in country into Vietnam and Malaysia to start the upgrade process. So once we have that validation through our lead line, we can start the replication process but that is still a constraint. We need to be able to get in country to upgrade the tool sets. And if unfortunately over the winter months, we see a new variant or something else that comes through and we're unable to travel in country then that's going to create further delays that we'll have to manage. What we have right now is the range that we've given to these are all going to be subject to negotiations with customers that we're going to have to work through. And we started them. Some of them have been pretty positive. Some of them have not, been as positive. And so we felt it was prudent to provide some potential impact to the extent that we are delayed in the rollout that we could see some adverse impact to our revenue next year, which if you look at the volume which we're going to ship next year we're talking somewhere around $0.01. But when you take a $0.01 across eight to nine gigawatts of shipments it becomes a pretty material impact pretty quickly. So we just wanted to make sure that it was transparent."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Pitzer Yes, , guys.  for letting me ask the questions. And congratulations on the solid results. Ganesh, I wanted to get into a little more detail about the difference between your microcontroller business being down sequentially and analog being up. It's -- your down is a lot less than TI s, and your up is a lot more than TI s, but it's the same dynamic that they saw in their September quarter. And they highlighted the fact that perhaps, customers were requesting less expedited orders, that there was a little bit of a cooling off. I'm just curious when you look at that gap, what was the big driver in the quarter? And as you look at the December guide, would you expect the microcontroller business to start to show some accelerating growth?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy It's a . I think they are just quarter-to-quarter timing, if you look at our June quarter results, microcontrollers were super strong in that quarter. We had more constraints that hit the microcontroller business in the September quarter. I wouldn't look at anything [Indiscernible] I don't want to one-quarter basis. Businesses, microcontroller as well as Analog are doing extremely well and I expect both of them will have nice growth as we go through the December quarter. There is no customer slowdown on one product line and the other product line. They're all constrained, they all have a substantial unsupported exiting the quarters."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gary Mobley Hey, everybody.  for taking my question. I look forward to catching up with everybody next week. I wanted to ask about the backlog, and your ability to fill that backlog over the next 4 consecutive quarters. I appreciate your commentary about how the capital equipment you plan intend to put in place is supportive of four quarters of sequential revenue growth. But what is the risk of not receiving the capital equipment because of long lead times, or lead times, or the inability to get desired capacity from partners, And is this roughly 6% sequential revenue growth, supported by more capacity, indicative of how you see it, unwinding for those remaining three quarters or so?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy So firstly, the 6% growth is a December quarter midpoint of guidance that we have. We're not making predictions for quarters beyond the December quarter. What we do see is enough capacity coming online. We have line of sight to what we're doing internally. We have line of sight to what we are working with our partners, so that we expect that every quarter, for the next four quarters, including December in it, we’ll have the opportunity for supply side growth. And right now, there's enough and more demand for all those quarters. It's really a matter of bringing their supply on and we don't see any major risks and being able to bring capacity on. There's always timing of pieces of equipment for a given factory, but that all comprehended in the way we're thinking about it. As we have gone along through this year, almost every month, we've been able to bring on something incremental in the capacity, which is why you've seen every quarter we've been able to show sequential growth in each of the quarters."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gary Mobley Appreciate that color Ganesh, with the ability to supply being the main strength of revenue, is it fair to say that over the next four quarters it's going to be hard to build distributor inventory anywhere above the 20-day level roughly where it's at today?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Bjornholt I really don't. I mean, just -- and Ganesh mentioned t hat earlier, but our unsupported backlog, that's -- it's both split between direct and distribution. So distributors would love to have more products and we're just not able to supply at this point in time. So I think it will be challenging, but it's hard to predict."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vivek Arya  for taking my question. There is some debate whether the preferred supplier programs or some of your peers, you call them antsy on our programs, are they ready enforceable or dependable? Because some of your competitors have chosen not to use them as much. So I'm just curious to get your perspective, why there is so much debate on use of these programs? What is their enforceability and dependability because ultimately your products are going in end markets that need products from your competitors as well, so those markets are not doing as well, then how enforceable are your contracts? How should we think about the fact you have this PSP backlog as to how dependable the forward outlook is. ."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy Firstly, I don't know all the different programs different people have and so I won't try to contrast with what we're doing. What we know in talking too many of our key customers, who really by the way drove how we designed and implemented this system, the PSP program, is that it is 1. Seen as highly valuable, 2. That it has grown over time, and 3. It continues to not only be strong, but people want to extend that PSP outlook. We have 12 months as our standard backlog requirement for it. There are people placing beyond 12 months, honest. And I think everybody is recognizing that the semiconductor content and the products that they are making are extremely important to their achieving the innovation in their products, their growth objectives, and therefore are much more in the mode of making sure that they have that thought through in the demand they place on us. And because it is non - cancellable, I also expect, and I believe every one of them is putting thought into where to have PSP backlog and where not to have PSP backlog, given by the strength of their business and the views they have for their growth."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gary Mobley It's hard to find one where there is no delinquency at this point. If I judged by the number of customer escalations I get involved in calls that I have to be able to respond to, it's an every segment. Clearly, what the news plays out has a -- got a higher component of automotive."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Prajib Rahmani Hi, congratulations,  quarter.  for taking my question. I had a little bit more of a longer-term question. I guess, a lead time for at least the 32-bit MCU seem to be still stretching and they’re well beyond 22 weeks is what I'm hearing. But if you look into 2022, how would you sort of paint the picture for investors around where -- I mean, where lead times had to buy, say, mid-2022? Do you get a sense that in the current market scenario that lead times might not compress much at all in 2022, or can you help us gauge that a little bit more?"

There's one side of that equation which is supply, and the other side of that equation is demand. If you look a year ago where we were, to where we are today, despite having brought significant supply online, we are farther behind in terms of the constraint or the unsupported that we have. And that's because demand grew even faster than the supply did. I don't know how 2022 is demand picture, and we have a good sense of our own supply and what we're doing. But how the demand picture will change and when that will change, I don't know. But at this point in time, if you judge by how much unsupported did we have every quarter, exiting each quarter, we've had five quarters in a row where we produced more, but had more unsupported exiting the quarter. And I am fully expecting that exiting December, it will be the 6th consecutive quarter where that's going to happen."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matt Ramsay  very much, guys. . I wanted to ask a little bit about the pricing environment and that's been topical given the big supply-demand imbalance in the industry. Ganesh, maybe you could talk a little bit about the comments that you made about having support for growth over the next four quarters from here. How much of that is based on supply coming online and how much of that is based on, I guess, better pricing or passing through higher input costs in terms of pricing? And whatever pricing you're putting in place right now, how durable do you feel that is as supply and demand may be converged down the line? ."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy So it's a multi-variable equation. It's hard to break out exactly what is from price and what is from capacity. We do have -- clearly what we're doing on the capacity side of adding more wafers to be able to run either in our fabs and our partner’s fabs, adding more assembly and test capacity, and so there is a  significant amount of unit growth that we're expecting going into 2022 and into 2023. The pricing for us is largely to be able to pass along cost increases that we're seeing, and to make sure that -- we usually will bunch them rather than try to do it on a regular basis. And -- so we wait to see how cost increases are coming into us, bunch of together at some point in time, and then pass on the price increase. But the exact mix of car -- or price increase versus unit thing I don't have, there is a significant amount of unit growth going into next year. As far as what happens far down time, I don't get the sense that input costs are going down and that pricing has to come down out in time. Things like the labor costs that have been going up, those are in -- they're not coming back down. A lot of the costs for material and equipment are requiring companies, not just us, but even our supply chain, to have significant capital spending to be able to not just expand factories, but build brand-new factories. And the cost structure when you are involved there are quite significant as well. So it is my belief that these price increases are here to stay. and at least to stay for a fair amount of time into '22 and '23."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Harlan Sur  and congratulations on the solid results and execution. Macro trends in China have been somewhat mixed, obviously, building in construction activity has been muted. Industrial activity seems to be relatively okay. Consumer is mixed and the team has really  real-time visibility on the end markets in China. Have you guys seen any slight inflections in China demand or is the supply demand gap just so wide that they're not able to provide enough supply even if things have down-shifted a bit?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy You know, it's a little early to put all that together. Some of the power changes were really in the late September time frame. The effects of Evergrande or any of the other ones when it percolates down to the rest of the chain that's involved there takes some time. There is no discernible end market color we have to provide on China. We continue to have enough demand and excess of supply that even if some of that demand were to soften, we still have a lot of unsupported demand for China today."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"William Stein .  for taking my question and I'll add my congratulations, especially on the outlook. One of the  things that Microchip's done over time is that you were very early on to recognize that similar to the industrial -- industrial companies, acquisitions in semi's could provide  opportunities for both cost synergies, but also revenue synergies. I'm hoping you might use this time to update us on your integration of Microsemi. It's been a couple of years, and I wonder if the current strong environment has either delayed or accelerated the synergies. Is there a lot more to go that maybe we all forgot about because demand has been so good? ."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Ganesh Moorthy So it's done outstanding for us and I think all the results we had hoped for and more have been delivered.
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Danely Hey, , guys. Just wondering about your lead times. How do you think your lead times compare versus the competitors? And does the difference in lead times, does that drive any share shifts? Do you think it will drive any share shifts?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy Of course, as we win those customers coming over to us because we are able to help them, we're also getting long-term commitments from them to stay with Microchip beyond the cycle."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Toshiya Hari Hi, .  for taking the question. I wanted to ask about PSP. Is there a skill or are there any patterns by device type or end market? Is the uptake of PSP stronger? For example, MCU s versus Analog versus FPGA or by end market. And I guess more importantly, customers who aren't signing up -- who are not signing up for PSP. What's typically the reason or the rationale that pretty much just wanting the flexibility, or is it something around pricing? Just curious why some customers opt to not sign up. ."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy The PSP by product line isn't particularly different. By end market, certainly that our end markets with more demand certainty, more demand durability. There are certain customers who have more financial capability to go behind the commitments that they are making with PSP. And those customers, and that end -- those end markets do have a higher proportion of the PSP backlog that we have. What a given customers rationale for not doing it can be any number of things. Either the markets or the financial s trength could also be their view of, do they or don't they need to be in the program? I can tell you that everybody who has signed up a PSP is getting priority and is seeing results that are to their benefit in a highly constrained environment where demand far exceeds supply. And we're leaving unsupported, going out of every quarter."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ambrish Srivastava But there's no -- it does, that's helpful, but there's no noncancellable term to this, right? It's just what's you could not fulfill. So it could be canceled down the road, just like any other backlog which is where multiple quarters, right?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy Our standard non - cancelable window is 90 days. Almost by definition, if somebody was asking for product in this quarter that we could not fulfill, it is all non - cancelable. PSP adds a second dimension of 12 months of non - cancelable on a rolling basis that customers would have. PSP backlog, which is significantly over 50%, is all 12 months of non - cancelable. Plus, anything non - PSP, in the next three months, is also non - cancelable."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Bjornholt To make sure this is clear, the unsupported backlog is both PSP backlog and non - PSP backlog. So, there's a lot of unsupported that is in the PSP program. We just can't meet the commitment. The requested committed [Indiscernible]"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Sanghi [Indiscernible] Ambrish is that, we don't even have enough supply to meet all the PSP needs. There is a sufficiently even PSP backlog, which is unsupported in the current quarter. And we'll continue to be unsupported for several quarters, will ship the last quarter and supported this quarter. But some of the current quarter backlog will not be supported this quarter we will support our next quarter. So some of the capacity quoted doors, byproduct, by technology, by fab are so constrained that PSP backlog is over 100% of that capacity."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Steve Sanghi And that is noncancellable over the next 12 months.
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Caso Yes, . . Two quick questions on pricing. And first, a clarification on the PSP program. And when the customer places the order on the PSP program, is there a firm pricing commitment with that order such that to protect it against further price increases? And if so, does that create a risk for you if your input costs increase over the next year when that product is on the books? And then just longer-term, do you feel that  there is a structural element to these input cost increases? The fear is that 1 point demand will eventually slow and will catch up with supply and demand and costs will start to come down again. Do you feel that's not likely to happen and if so why?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Eric Bjornholt So Matt, maybe I can -- expand a little bit on Ganesh 's first point on pricing, just to explain how it works. So if we have a price increase, the customer has 5 days once that price increase goes out to make the decision, do they want to accept that price increase or not? And if they don't accept the price increase that comes back to Microchip and does Microchip choose to ship it at a lower price, or do we reallocate that capacity when there's so much capacity on the books when customers are screaming for product to another customer. And what we've seen, what we've had price increases, is that there has been hardly any consumers that cancel their orders or choose not to accept the price increase because they understand the situation on the supply side."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Christopher Rolland Hey, guys. Just following up on that as well. And Ganesh, you may have already answered this, but we are hearing about pricing increases from a bunch of your competitors across microcontroller and Analog. And some of this is input costs, but some of this is also opportunistic. So I guess my first question is, how you guys feel about that and whether you have a plan around pricing moving forward. And then Steve, I always love your big picture thoughts. And so, as it relates to pricing, the more pricing power that's enacted here, when this all ends, does this pricing revert or is there something structural and you think it might be stickier this cycle versus other cycles, given that there are fewer competitors out there than in past decades?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy Okay, I'm trying remembering, what was the first part of the question again?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Christopher Rolland That first part is pricing increases from your competitors. Do you guys have a plan there, and then thoughts on a bigger picture on pricing and sticking."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Sanghi So, my feeling is that the pricing, wherever the pricing has increased, I do not see that pricing coming down longer term on the proprietary products. On some of the commodity products, if there is a lot of supply becomes available and there is a competition that is able to ship DRAM, or a flash, or NAND. Those pricing may come down, but I don't see pricing on our microcontroller products or analog products, connectivity products, 98% of what we make is largely proprietary, those prices to come down, because when you look at the components of the pricing, the -- I don't see that fabs are going to lower the wafer cost, outside, because they're making huge investments because of shortage and that equipment is being placed in -- now. And what would be the reason to lower the price later? The -- if the commodity prices come down, there is a small component of the overall costs where that will come down . And as Ganesh mentioned earlier, the label cross-sell are not likely to come down. The assembly test costs are not likely to come down. Our internal fabrication and other costs are not going to come down. We're paying more for the equipment and that structurally stays in the cost structure. So I don't really see that the price increases that were passing onto their customers are temporary in nature, nor are we giving that kind of impression to our customers. I think they're largely there to stay. Could there be a minor adjustment here and there if there was a significant cost downwards from the input cost perspective? Then it's possible, but I don't really see it."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Harlan Sur  for letting me ask a follow up. The gross margin expansion has been very impressive. And I know you'll be providing your long-term margin target next week, but more near-term. If I look at the December quarter guide and the last 3 reported quarters, you guys ' incremental gross margins are in a pretty tight range, right?"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Sanghi And even the insight factories, the gross margin goes up -- incremental gross margin is much higher when you're going from under-utilized factories to full utilization. Once you're at full utilization, and you're adding capital which you are adding depreciation, then you're shipping that product, the incremental gross margin is not as high as you would think. Remember, we also ship first-in, first-out. So even when the factory becomes full, under-utilization goes away, you're still shipping product which you built earlier, when the utilize -- the increasing capital wasn't added. Now we're adding incremental capital to grow the capacity and that depreciation comes in. Therefore, the incremental gross margin is better than the average because you're utilizing the factory better, the management, fixed infrastructure, the ecosystem the water, they air, everything else; you are using it more efficiently. So there is incremental gross margin, which is higher than corporate. But your metric of what it has been in the last four quarters may not stay."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Christopher Rolland Perfect. Okay. Looking forward to next week. .
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David O’Connor .  and  for squeezing me in here. Maybe just one follow-up, Ganesh, to your comment earlier in your prepared remarks about a license for wafer manufacturing technology on an 8-inch. And what was the just wondering what [Indiscernible] for that what you need to take that [Indiscernible]. Was it some large design win or was there some change in the technology road map that requires this or even anything around the end market, where that is going and how significant it could be? That would be helpful. ."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy It's an 8-inch trailing edge technology that we see having lots of legs for many years in key end markets and with key customers that the products are built on. The appetite to invest, there are the priority invest there did not rise to the level to make that investment from our partners. And so we worked to get it licensed and to be able to do it ourselves, very consistent with what we said last time and this time, that we will be increasing our capacity investments in trailing edge technologies, where our partners do not see the same opportunity to invest. But we see that opportunity and priority for what we do. So that's all that it represents."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David O’Connor , everyone, and congrats on the results. Ganesh, your comment that the growth and unsupported backlog, I think it implies that your bookings continue to accelerate or at least they're outgrowing your billings. A, is that correct? And B, if that's the case, why do you think you continue to see such acceleration or outgrowth in your bookings, and is that implied that you're seeing increasing number of expedites because I'm assuming that also ties up to how many -- how much broader customers are asking for the current quarter."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy We have and people would like to get it sooner than we can provide it to them, and so a lot of factors that go into that unsupported. But the bottom line is, that whatever we are able to produce and the growth that we're able to deliver, despite it being 26% year-over-year, is far from what is required to meet what customers are telling us what they want in a given quarter. And that keeps squeezing out and we keep shipping more every quarter and we'll squeeze some more out in the several subsequent quarters that we can't ship into this quarter. And it just reflects how demand is continuing to outstrip, or the demand growth is continuing to outstrip the supply growth for multiple quarters. And we do not see a bending of that curve through much of 2022."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Pitzer Guys,  for letting me ask the follow-up. I had two quick ones. Eric, just on the CapEx, you guided for this year. I'm just kind of curious how we should think about next year, especially given the exit trajectory. And then Ganesh, you guys are really kind enough to give us both kind of a revenue number and an end market demand number. I'm just kind of curious of how to think --how we should think about the relationship between the two, because this quarter, it did look like your revenues were above end demand, and I'm just trying -- to understand what that means, especially in light of how constrained you seem to be in the business."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ganesh Moorthy For multiple quarters, you've seen that the end market demand has been higher and the GAAP revenue that we've had. The difference at this quarter is small. Distribution inventory still continue to decline by one day. In this case, there's nothing meaningful in that number for this quarter."
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Steve Sanghi Well, it's basically constrained by distribution inventory. They don't have much to ship. What they have left is really all slower moving slots. They need a lot of new product from us to be able to increase the end-market demand, and in some cases, some of the product has been prioritized to PSP customers and there is more direct PSP backlog than the distribution backlog. Significantly, more direct customers have gone PSP than through distribution. So therefore, much more of the product has been skewed towards direct customers, and distribution would like more, but there is no capacity. So I think that would limit --"
4465750,Microchip Technology Incorporated,MCHP,11/5/2021,CEO Ganesh Moorthy on Q2 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Pitzer That it makes a lot of sense, Steve; I think we're all learning that perhaps supply chains are a little bit more complex than that we once thought."

I guess, Keith, you spent some extra time talking about the supply chain and it's certainly the most frequent question I've gotten from investors, particularly over the past three weeks. So could you maybe help us understand, what kind of headwind you're quantifying or accounting for in your 4Q guide? Where you might see risks in the supply chain? And then, what you might be seeing from peers, particularly where you may be benefiting from having supply where your peers may not have product?"
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ken Xie Brian is a 10 [Indiscernible] I feel we are little bit better position compare to competitor. First, it's why we have the quantity much louder than our competitor. We are probably like a 3x compared to the fiscal on a unit shipment, maybe [Indiscernible] pulled out of some other, which gave us better negotiation power be similar to supply, and also will manage all these more directly compared our competitor [Indiscernible] some sort of party. that's given us better visibility and also can act quicker earlier. Second, we have quite a broad product line. Bolstering the FortiGate and also NAMA FortiGate is an easier for our customer to go to the next line of products has a similar performance and then all running the FortiOS in FortiOS. So it's a more easy to use in some different product to sell better some of their product shortage. And also, we have a  team -- operation side. And the same time, we have a culture more than less than a long term both on their inventories and market sales compared to our competitor. To me, some even [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] 5, 10, 15 years ago, we tend to keep some more trade to me customer urgent needs. So that's actually been for that supply chain issue."

I want to focus on the most important part, which is the growth acceleration. Your revenue -- your product revenue growth, went from 25% to 41% to 51% in the last 3 quarters. And your billing growth, went from 14% to 35% to 42%, it's just a major acceleration. And the question is, can you identify the key areas? I know that a lot of areas are growing, but when you look at material areas, meaning that the most -- the highest contribution to the growth acceleration. What are the key areas? Can you share with us the key areas, where you see the highest growth in terms of dollars? And can you also give us an update on SD-WAN specifically? ."

FortiGate is small really to -- because like, a whether the internal SEC communications to protect all these read somewhere or go to the when I stick us, you went. And also  the Non-FortiGate more tied to the story, the fabric Fortinet security fabric, which is also Gartner sat in promoting the core cybersecurity mash architecture, which can reduce the financial costs of our single event by legacy, 90%. I think that this falls contributor for the gross, like a key said. And also some vendor consolidation, we see some smaller vendors starting got weaker and weaker. So we do see some market share gain here also."

4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Keith Jensen I would just echo what Ken said Tal for -- but I think the threat landscape as a hot topic of conversation in all quarters of other world have seen right now. And it doesn't seem like that's going to abate anytime soon. I think the needs -- what can and team have built here with the body security and network -- networking speeds is critical. But I think also this platform of our gardeners now call it, calling the mesh architecture -- cybersecurity mesh architecture, I think consistent with partners all the reports about, the percentage of companies we are looking for consolidation, I think Ken's commented on that, and how that's going to continue to increase it. It's certainly seemed to those tailwinds, are poised to continue to exist as we get into 2022"

And I certainly don't see any reason that just on that basis that it was slowed down. And I think if you overlay that with investments that, Ken and team are now making, particularly as it relates to the U.S. Federal team. I think there's some opportunities for us is to explore and exploit hopefully as we move forward."

4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Sterling Auty Yes. . Hi guys. The ongoing asked my 1 question is an extension of what Michael was just talking about. I'm curious as you look a t the growth in the quarter, even if it's qualitative, can you help characterize for us how much of that growth is coming from actual displacement of solutions, both traditional cybersecurity and networking, versus how much of that growth is coming from existing customers, buying additional expansion. An additional product is just a build-out the handle their growth needs."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ken Xie Also, the existing customers keep expanding [Indiscernible]. Something like security plus structure approach, like adding to one side, I see 1 5G and also expand with the internal segmentation and Wi - Fi security data center security. So that's what I can boast about. I do see probably maybe more come from the cost keeping expanding their security infrastructure."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Rob Owens Yeah.  for taking my question. I guess I'll pivot a little bit from Sterling and ask about G2K specifically, and what is driving the strength in G2K billings. Is that products related, is it just better distribution relationships that are getting you into these accounts and who do you think share is coming from in this market? ."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Keith Jensen I think the -- I would give a general comment in terms of where -- who is the market share gainers and who are the market share donors? I don't think there'll be any surprises. I've actually -- the mentioned names in terms of, who I thought those were. In terms of distribution, I think when you get in, particularly in the U.S. market with a large enterprise focused distributors, you've got a -- as a Company, you've got to invest in time and bring opportunities to them and demonstrate that, you have a superior product, a superior offering. And I think that, the team has done the heavy lifting on that. And I do believe that, we are getting more momentum, if you will, from those large U.S. distributors that, maybe we did not have previously. So I think there's some of that. And then I think we've continued to invest in both the sales and the marketing. We knew all along for several years now that, we needed to improve our coverage in terms of [Indiscernible] accounts that we're assigned to wraps. And the people that we're bringing in from outside and that, maybe had more of an enterprise experience unless of a channel experience, etc. So I do think that all those things have combined and are demonstrating the success, as you pointed out, G2000 growth at over 52% and accelerated for the last three quarters."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Hamza Fodderwala Hey guys,  for taking my question. I'm going to keep it to one question. But just on the OT side, you talked about that growing 77% this quarter. I think those are the first-time you mentioned that product specifically. Just curious, can you give us any rough sense of how material that's becoming to your overall billings and what's been driving that in more recent quarters?"
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Keith Jensen I think it's not as big as SD-WAN but growing faster. But also, I don't think we're -- I think that it's reached a point, if you will in terms of size that we're comfortable and we think its worthwhile making sure that we share with people outside the Company with those growth levels. If you combine SD-WAN and an OT together as a percentage of billings, you're going to get to something. I think that's over 20% of our total billings."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Adam Morgens Hey guys and  so much for taking the question. Maybe j ust for Ken, so back at September, you guys signed a partnership with Linksys around securing work from home environments and segmenting corporate and personal networks. And I know one of your competitors also announced a similar idea. So how should we think about the idea of securing home networks and effectively the whole becoming extension of a branch office of one and the opportunity to do that as we live in this work from anywhere world going forward?  so much."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ken Xie It's a new market. It has a lot of potential supporting work from anywhere. That's where we partnered with LNG sales and which has down in home networking area for quite a while. And we do believe it's a -- eventually a lot of reasons if it's all these IOT are modest in connect online. And also a lot of our workforce and school from [Indiscernible] is kind of since there at all when neither Security, which we combined with the netw ork security while endpoint security and also the clouds amount SASE. So we do feel it's a big long-term potential. But as it's a not quite. I mean that -- the business actually ramp up quickly, but it's an eventually will contribute more revenue for the Company."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,Ken Xie . And next we have Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is now open.
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Ho Hi, . Congrats on the strong results. Just wanted to, I guess, understand a little bit better the dynamics around the price increases to your base. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude or impact of the quarter from those increases? And is there a potential for that to stick even beyond some of these supply chain challenges? ."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Keith Jensen I would add to that, Jonathan, the -- one of the metrics that we look at in the third quarter, which is our ability to hold the line of the price increases, which were largely effective on August 1st. I'd say largely because you have to give notice to your channel partners, which is appropriate. And you can imagine them taking certain actions to get orders in the 1st month of the quarter, if you will. So it gets a little bit distorted that way. But we do look at our ASPs and wanting to make sure and are discounting that, we're not giving back that price increase, if you will. And overall, I think the headline is that, we think we were on the direct product line. I think it was secretive to the margin in the quarter. And I emphasize the direct, because as volatile as it is, predicting things like expedite fees and sometimes, freight prayed as well, can come into that line. So I think overall, when you factor in direct and indirect, we're probably in a wash for the quarter."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Gray Powell ,  and congratulations on the good numbers. So yeah, within your Non-FortiGate billings, can you roughly give us a sense as to how much is related to appliances versus software and Cloud? And then how should we think about supply chain issues potentially impacting Non-FortiGate in Q4?"
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Keith Jensen Yeah. I think the Non-FortiGate mix is something on the order of about -- we talked about this before, something we were at 30% to 40% of that is Cloud or software. And the remainder will be a hardware form factor. As I mentioned in the call, I think the first place that we saw supply chain pressure in this third quarter, was in non-FortiGate, more specifically around switches and access points."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Andrew Niwinski .  and congrats on a  quarter. I want to ask about the high-end, that was certainly better than expected. I think over 37% of your FortiGate sales, which looks like it was the highest level of spend in at least the last two years. Can you talk about the drivers of the high-end? And whether the 5G rollouts in your leadership position in the carrier market might be contributing to that?"
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ken Xie Yeah. The big enterprise, the Global 2000 that contributes some high-end growth. And also on the product we have fresh [Indiscernible] And I think in the last 1 to 2 years, we also refresh a higher-end. You've seen the latest ASIC for MPS -7, which has have 5 x better performances and more function compared with the previous MP6, which I see the high-end we probably were scratched like, maybe 80% of the [Indiscernible] is already. So that's also we said in benefit some of these refresh we made in the last 1 to 2 years."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,Andrew Niwinski No contribution from the 5G carrier-class customers there? There's more on the enterprise?
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ken Xie There's some contribution from SD-WAN. But it's the 5G steering the ramp up stage. I don't see much, but I do see the huge potential."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,Ken Xie . And next we have Irvin Liu from Evercore ISI. Your line i s now open.
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Irvin Liu Hi, . This question is for either Ken or Keith. You have the opportunity to meet with several customers and partners along with new prospects that, you’re first of its kind Security Summit, that's the place that you're sponsored PGA Fortinet championship event. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing -- what you're seeing from a customer traction perspective, post the event. And perhaps if the event had led to a notable uptick in visibility and mindshare among customers."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Keith Jensen I would come over the topic and completely echo, and what Ken had to say. I've just -- I'm shocked at how enthusiastic I am about how that event came out. Whether we look at, what we call whitespace names that, we got from, say SMP 500. The percentage of attendees that were non-customers, and it was sit with us on one-to-one sessions and hear more about our story and the household names that were there, it was fantastic. I think the branding with the marketing team pulled together with that, together with Silverado Country Club, was extremely successful. And I think also, it goes back to some of the comments we made earlier in the conversation. I think it was -- it really struck Fortinet at the right time in terms of its call its maturity, right? I think that the team here was, really in a good position to execute against that. I was in a customer meeting yesterday here in Sunnyvale, with a very large Company that come to the event. And so it was a follow-up. And there have been other very large companies that have come to our ABC events here in Sunnyvale. And just in the first month and a half after the event, I'm just really impressed with what the guys did. Guys and ladies between."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,Keith Jensen Yeah [Operator Instructions] Next we have Keith Bachman from BMO. Your line is now open.
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Keith Bachman  very much. I was -- wanted to direct this towards Keith. Keith, as you think about the billings guide, what you're suggesting EBITDA high-end, the billings' sequential growth would be about 13% in the past 2 years, you've grown billing sequentially, about 28%. So obviously a little less on the guide. I'm just wondering if you could just give us some color or thoughts around that. And in particular, is that a reflection of -- was there any kind of pull in that you think about on the billings, were customers concerned about not getting product? And/or is it reflecting some of the concerns you previously mentioned about are we going to have enough of the supply chain availability or product availability I should say. And therefore, we might need to tamp down a little bit in Q4. And then I have a follow-up if I could, because Peter told me I'm allowed to ask a follow-up."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Keith Jensen Again. Look, I think what you're seeing there is supply chain. And as I said earlier in the conversation, that I think they -- we've been appropriately conservative, I hope, in terms of how we guided to it. To unpack that, just a little bit, we do with our sales team, and we manage things on a bookings basis with them. And then we put that up against what we have the ability to ship. If I look at just the bookings number and we had a long internal conversation about whether or not that's a metric that we should provide in this time and decided not to. But if we look at just the bookings number, I would say that, it's a very strong indicator that the business is extremely healthy, if you will. In terms of customer buying behavior there's always somebody getting in line early, if you will. That they have longer-term deployment or what have you. That's not new and maybe a little bit of it in the third quarter, no deal is over $10 million or they are the largest deal with probably seven or eight or something like that in the quarter. We have seen in the fourth-quarter things where customers I'd say they are getting line orders. They've got deployments where our plans for deployin g in 2022. And they want to make sure that, they're trying to time, when they are actually going to need the product and when the product is going to be available. So I have seen early in the quarter, a few companies exhibiting that behavior."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Keith Bachman We're hearing that a little bit from the channel, not the lead times, because they're getting out, customers are ordering early in more. But it sounds like what you're saying, essentially you are concerned about maybe the billings number reflects some -- you might not be able to make all shipment demand and so that's reflected in the quarter from -- I hope I'm not putting words in your mouth."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Keith Jensen No, absolutely. I think that would be a very prudent thing to say, with the supply train environment that we're in, I'm not just going to take the -- I can't just take the absolute booking number to shift,  but I think there's been a fair amount of internal work around that if you will, now, on the other side, it does give us more predict more predictability as we come into 2022 of this behavior continues. So we've had in the past. Backlog or bookings has not been something that -- Ford as a Company has really had reason or cause to talk about. And I don't know that as of today that we do. But as we get further into the fourth quarter and then moving into 2022, that maybe something that because of the predictability that it helps with, we may be talking about that next year."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Keith Bachman Okay. And my Peter -sanctioned second question then, is if you talk a little bit about the non-FortiGate mix. And I know you mentioned that in one of the previous questions, but how do you see that changing over the course of the next couple of quarters, if at all? And I'm not really talking about a supply chain constraint, but just on demand related pools. As customers may look as they're deploying that incremental 6,000 customers and er penetration on your existing -- do you see the software side moving up, if you will, in the non-FortiGate component. And then I will cede the floor. ."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ken Xie That's where what do we call Fabry on mash. We see put his strong demand from a customer and we both increased the amount repurchase also the customer about that anything new multiple products, Fabry are matched solution. So that's where we Canadian few hall restaurant growth sound non-op 40-k. And Also we said we'll can be assemblies provide a carrier on the SaaS east and modest solution. You eventually will also benefit broader customer base."
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,Keith Bachman Okay. All right. Many  and congratulations for the incredible results.
4465755,"Fortinet, Inc.",FTNT,11/5/2021,CEO Ken Xie on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Ken Xie . And there are no further questions at this time. That concludes the Q&A session.

And this concludes today's conference call.  all for participating. You may now disconnect."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alexander Goldfarb Hey, , Don. 1, it's  to see that you already are putting out '23 and '24 guidance. So, I guess it's going to be the standard thing you'll -- you're going to sandbag those and next quarter we'll see those numbers raised as well. But the bigger question here, Don, is what is actually going on asset properties at the operations everywhere that the recovery is so strong and the tenant demand is so strong? Meaning, a number of years ago, tenants were still coming to your centers, taking space. They could see the consumer shopping at your properties. What is going on now that it's supercharged? Is it just merely that these tenants don't have the threat of the online shopping? I mean, it's just been incredible and I know I've asked this question before, but the pace of demand across retail this quarter is just mind-blowing and it just really begs the question for these retailers really just holding back before? Or is it really fleshing out of the bad credit that's allowed you guys to have better space to rent to people who are willing to pay higher rents?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood Well, first of all Alex, it's good to know that you are very predictable in terms of the first part of your statements are not a question. But the -- in terms of the bigger -- in terms of the question you're asking, it's a whole bunch of things. It's not just one thing, but certainly the notion of the amount of time that -- there are a lot of people assume certainly in our markets have not -- had not been out and had been at home and have restrictions one way or the other. I got to tell you, as you know, that gets old. And so, you would have thought -- I think you're seeing a revised -- rejuvenises if you will, low for socialization. I can tell you any restaurants, certainly in New York, that you would see you would be -- you can't even get a reservation. And we're seeing that same thing throughout our properties. So, people want to be out. Tenants are upgrading their space and having the ability. Obviously, I'm talking at our portfolio primarily, but having the ability to get into better real estate, in a portfolio that was as low as 89% is some-odd percent leased. That's just rare as it gets perfect. And so, the ability to actually have a chance to upgrade is -- it's a huge driver as we've been talking about all the way through. From a consumer perspective, you've certainly got the demand. From a real estate perspective, the tenant perspective, you certainly have the demand, and then the other side of it is -- and this surprise me. You can call it sandbagging or whatever, but it's surprised me that we have not lost more tenants over the past 6 or 8 months in 2021. The notion of tenants holding on to their properties and finding a way to make it through and not wanting to lose their superior positions from real estate was er than we expected. So, the combination of not losing them, having availability from the 89% coming back up, and the strong consumer demand, you put those 3 things together. And I think you've got the bulk of the answer to your question. And we have a say and we don't see a change to that, at this point. That's continuing strong in an innovative way."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alexander Goldfarb Okay. And then the second is on Office, you had a win with Choice Hotels and I think you mentioned Santana West. We all hear the low return of Office numbers and yet all the Office companies talk about the really strong leasing that's going on. Clearly, you're seeing that in demand for your different mixed-use project. So, as you look out over the next 12 months, how many new office projects do you think you could start based on the conversations that you're having today, is it just 1 or 2? Or you think you can easily balance 4, 5 or 6 buildings to go?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood No, no. No, Alex. It's the trice building. It's one. For us, first of all, just get it all in perspective. There is Assembly Row with office Pike & Rose, with office potential opportunities and it's Santana Row. In all 3 markets, the demand is there. The Santana West is a different kettle of fish because it's one big building that we're looking for one big tenant to take the whole thing. At Assembly, the -- what has happened to the building that was Puma and just boom up forever has been astonishing in the past period of time. There you may see us able to announce another building next year. We're working it hard right now. But to your point, that demand could mean that there's a faster route to the next building. In terms of Pike & Rose, we certainly didn't expect to be announcing another office building here, as you know, building we just moved into. We were the only tenants in here on August 10th of 2020. The notion that this building is 90% or 89, whatever it is, percent lease, and our conversations with Choice, who originally started about this building, was such that we could not accommodate them. We needed, if we wanted to do that deal, to started another building. It's astonishing. And I don't think this is even handed throughout the country. Obviously, there's a whole question of what happens to office-based as in terms of needs going forward over the next decade. But I know if you're in an amenity rich environment with new buildings in places like where we are. I know you are in the catbird seat. Because I'm seeing it in terms of the deals we're doing. So, 1, maybe 2 buildings over the next year."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Craig Schmidt , . I just -- the acquisitions in your acquisition pipeline, are these still deals that you originated in 2020, or are they deals that you struck up since '21 started? And how  are you doing with the more competitive cap rates?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Berkes when you also have a portfolio that was hit harder during COVID and therefore has more room to grow to get back to a stabilized occupancy. So, there are other levers, if you will, to flow that continue the growth. And frankly, any acquisitions are the cherry on top of an already very robust growth profile."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Craig Schmidt Right. And then just on the other arm of external growth, maybe you could talk about Huntington. And do you already have anchor lined up to take the newly constructed anchor and small shops space?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood Yeah, let's talk about Huntington. First of all, I think Simon did an amazing job, amazing job at the adjacent Walt Whitman Mall to Huntington. They did -- they just did a  job bringing the entire profile of that product up to what that market frankly deserves. That -- but we would've liked to have done something similar at Huntington, but we have leases in place which are restricted. Well, COVID took care of that, didn't it? And so, the notion of being able, therefore, to go and lock in Whole Foods as our anchor, which we have, is a game changer. And so now the future of Huntington, which will marry up very nicely to a brand-new Whitman mall adjacent to it, with a Whole Foods anchored center, on that piece of land, I mean, it's gold. Give us a couple of years to get it built out and done, and that'll be another avenue for future growth for Federal."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Craig Schmidt Yes. It seems like you're laying the groundwork for an extended period of above average growth, given that this would open in 2024."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood It's certainly feels like it, Greg, it certainly feels like."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Katy Mcconnell . I Just had another one on the new office plans for Pike & Rose. I'm wondering if you can provide some context around what you're expecting from a cost perspective? And just based on leasing progress to date would you expect somewhere close to the office portion of Phase 3?
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood It's a , Katie. And so, we are pretty darn good shape in locking up our costs, but we're not all the way there yet. Basically, at the end of the day, we should be able to yield as fix, and potentially better on the building. The building will be close to $200 million to build, hopefully not that high, but somewhere around that spot. And so, what it does, and that's a fully loaded 6, to the extent you talked about incremental will be higher. We're really just thrilled to be able to take what we've done and capitalize on it. I couldn't imagine starting that in a place that wasn't already very established with the amenity that's already here."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Katy Mcconnell Okay. . And then just start on the results and we saw a big confident straight-line this quarter. I'm curious if you've started converting any of your cash basis tenants back to accrual this quarter? And how should we think about the run rate straight line going into 2022? It's probably going to be lumpy.
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dan Guglielmone It will be lumpy, but it should grow with all the office leasing that we're doing. The big driver was boomer this quarter, which is still in a free rent period. But as we do more and more office leasing, that's going to push to our straight-line rent increasing, and that should increase next quarter and into 2022. And no changes to how we're assessing cash to accrual."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Derek Johnston Have any of the big 3 master mixed-use developments recovered more briskly? Are there any leading or notable laggards? And if so, does that bode well for a snap-back in demand clearly for the laggard in the coming quarters or would you describe leasing demand as being relatively balanced across the big 3?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood I would. I would say it's balanced now. And all 3 of them, they got hurt a lot more obviously than the essential base properties throughout the portfolio. And so those 3 still are not back to where they are going to be or where we want them at all. So yes, there is outside growth at those properties because as you know -- I mean, the office leasing is just one component of what we're seeing. And then you can imagine what it's doing to the retail side, in terms of the leasing that's coming to fill space that hadn't been there before. That growth will continue and we will take all of 2022, the variant in the 2023 where you'll continue to see that out-sized growth from those 3 properties space. They are special properties now. That is where people want to be. It's also, as you can imagine, where people want to live. And so, I think we're like 97% leased at us at the residential component of those assets. Certainly, we have some restrictions in the jurisdictions that they're in on the ability to increase rents in the case of Montgomery County, and evict in the case of Summerville and Massachusetts. But overall, when you sit and you think about those, they were the places of choice. And so, we see some real good long-term growth on that component, of those mixed-use properties also."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Derek Johnston Oh, okay . And to -- just back to the off-market COVID era acquisitions, especially the 4 big ones prior to Twinbrooke or even including Twinbrooke. With private markets, which we've discussed being competitive and cap rates compressing, where do you feel those 4 assets would trade if they were being marketed today versus in the throes of the pandemic or how much value do you think is already been harvested in your view?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood Significant. And Jeff and I argue about this, cause it's all conjecture, right? Who knows? But when you look at what things are trading at, all the way through, I'm thinking 15%, maybe 20% more? Big numbers."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Greg Mcginniss Hey, . So, Dan, and I apologize, I know you've covered some of this already. Could you please just outline the one-time items in Q3 results or changes expected into Q4? And then what are the base assumptions that underlie future guidance? And especially if you could just touch on the expected cadence of occupancy recovery, that'd be pretty appreciated. ."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dan Guglielmone Sure. I mean, the big items for next quarter is as I mentioned, a little higher expenses of property level of repairs and maintenance, demo, and other expenses. I don't expect prior period meant to be as strong consistently, a bit poor forecasters of prior period rents. I think at some point that's going to fall off and I think this quarter feels like it probably is the quarter that has happened. I think we will be issuing and we plan to be issuing about a $150 million to $200 million of equity in the quarter, which will call some drag. And then G&A is expected to be a bit higher due to compensation expenses. So those are the main drivers that take us all Focal 151 that we had this quarter. And then in terms of cadence of occupancy, I think next year, like by year-end, we should see continued growth in our occupancy percentage from the 90.2 where it is today, probably somewhere between 90.5 and 91, in that range. And then over the course, we'll be somewhere -- I think we should get into the 92s by year-end 2022. So somewhere between 92% and 93% is probably somewhere in that range is the cadence on occupancy."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Greg Mcginniss Okay. , . And then thinking about lease structure post-pandemic, have there been any changes in these terms or needs from retailers and office tenants as we talk to them today?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Wendy Seher On the retail side, Greg, I don't see any changes. I did when we were in the middle of COVID, and as we're coming out, I see that we're in a strong position to negotiate what I call real deals and also participate in some cases in a percentage override. So, no, I think that we're in a strong position to continue to negotiate strong contracts for the future."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Greg Mcginniss And on the office side, have you've seen any changes?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood Yeah, activity. No, I like the way Wendy put it, Greg, they are real deals. And so, yeah there's a lot of capital, there is a lot of capital on all deals today and that is a trend that continues, but the rent pays for it. And so, when you look at it net of capital, these are good deals."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Juan Sanabria Hi.  for the time. Just curious on a couple of the hot topic items. One, inflation and two supply-chain issues. What impacts they are having? Do you expect the supply chain issues to have the lease versus occupied spread right now? Further before contracts given maybe some delays in getting permits and/or parks, you mentioned HVAC units and I'm just curious on how you see inflation impacting the profitability of your tenants. In particular, I'm curious about your thoughts on the grocers."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood There's a lot to unpack in there. And certainly, as I tried to hit in the prepared remarks, the supply chain issues are so broad that yeah, they got to be managed really tightly, and there is absolutely risk there. And so, when you take a -- you go from lease to actually getting a tenant opened, we had better be proactive. And we have been extremely proactive about whether it be allowing for a larger lead time, whether it be moving ahead with work effectively before everything is all tied up. A big one and I've -- Wendy mentions this all the time, and that's how I know it must be pervasive, is using our relationships with our tenant to be able to divide up work for who has the best leverage in a situation to get the appropriate supplies, or to trade some things out, has been really effective. So, I am certainly not expecting us to have significant delays throughout the year, there will certainly be example where we do, there will be other examples where we'll beat it. But it does -- but your point is important. It has to be a very proactive and creative way to deal with something that is, in some respects, uncontrollable. So, we'll see how that plays out, so far so good. And then on the costs, really good thing that the biggest piece of our development pipeline is already locked in and is -- even as I sit here on 909 Rose, our office building here, this building was built with 2018 money. And even though there's been a delay and has taken longer to effectively get it leased up. Now that it has, those deals are really good deals on 2018 money. And so, this will work out just fine same way at Santana, same way up in assembly. On a new stuff, we got a lock in early, best we can. Lock in price escalation, we got to leverage buying power with bulk purchases. We have the sole source alternate suppliers. It's all part of a very proactive and tightly controlled development organization. I think we're really good at."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Juan Sanabria , Don. And then just my follow-up would just be on cap rates for acquisitions, you're looking at -- you mentioned in the release that you're aggressively looking for opportunities. Should we think of those as opportunities for those mid to high 4s for stabilized assets or are you targeting more redevelopment opportunities that maybe have some potential for you guys to add value with your platform and or leasing expertise? Just curious on how we should be thinking about that going forward."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood I think you're really need to think about it from an IRR perspective. Because going in cap rates today are so -- you don't even know what the NOI or the POI is being captives when people talk about cap rates the way they are. Because of the disruptions of COVID, because of the assumptions being made about releasing and things like that. You have to dig deeper when somebody gives you a cap rate. What -- so from our perspective, we don't say no to something at a 4 or say yes to something at a 6 based on that cap rate, we are looking at where we can create value in that real estate. And honestly, looking at IRR, with IRR assumptions. So, to the extent our IRR is over and above 150 basis points of our cost of capital as we define it, we like that deal. Sometimes 100 basis points over, sometimes 200 basis points over. We look at our IRR in a I'm very honest, sober way because I think if you only think about it in cap rate perspective, you miss the opportunities of the both."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Goldsmith , Don, Dan.  for taking my question. Your occupied percentage grew 50, 60 basis points sequentially, but lease occupancy grew a bit less than that sequentially. So, can you help bridge the gap between all the strong commentary about what you're seeing in retail leasing and how that's reflected in your lease percentage? And then also is 200,000 square feet to 250,000 square feet of new leases the right piece to expect going forward?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dan Guglielmone With regards to the lease percentage being a little slower, it was actually reversed the last quarter where our lease percentage was up significantly by 90 basis points, something like that. Look, it's quarter-to-quarter, look for the trends. We see trends continuing upwards on our lease percentage, quarter-over-quarter, some quarters may be a little slower. We had some tenants left. We took some space back. There were some issues that came up this quarter that put a little bit of a damper on our lease percentage momentum. But we would expect given the leasing activity that we have and the leasing activity in unoccupied space that we see, we should see -- that should resume to a better than basis point increase that you saw this quarter. I think one thing to comment, Don, is that while our occupied percentage grew 60 basis points, I don't think we had any impact. We got rent started, and it was I think a strong quarter for that in terms of getting tenants in, getting them rent-paying. And that's going to ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. Don't look at any one particular quarter, look at the trends over time. And I think you see looking backwards, the trends have been very positive than I think that going fo rward we should expect that as well."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Goldsmith That's really helpful. And then on longer-term question. Don, you've talked a lot about reaching $7 a share in FFO over the past several calls in this updated guidance. If you take the high end of '22 numbers and you get that 10% growth in '23 and '24, you're going to get there. So , what has to go right in order for you to get their kind of by the end of 2024?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood What's happening now. The single biggest thing that's going to impact the timing of the trajectory is the lease up of the Santana West building in California. As I've said, that's an on-off switch. Or hopefully it's an on-off switch because it's a we're looking for a single tenant user the building, at least the majority of the building. So, the timing of that creates variability in that trajectory. And the second thing is, I am very confident this is going to be a 95% leased portfolio. That trajectory of that 95, we have to see. To the extent that is quicker will get the seventh faster to the extended slower. We'll get it to its lower. But basically, what we're seeing happening now, the continuation of that will get you there. I hope that's helpful."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Haendel St. Juste Hey, there. I guess my first question is on capital allocation. You talked a lot about the cap rate compression in the market seeing grocer deals in the 4.5%, 5%, I guess I'm curious how you think about incremental dispositions in the face of this strength to fund some of your external growth pursuits? And how that maybe you're thinking about your stock as currency with implied cap here in the high 4% range?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood And Haendel, just to make the point, we expect stock rates go up, and accordingly when you're looking at capital allocation, how you're going to fund our growth, whether that's with those dispositions or whether it's with equity or, you know we take a balanced approach. So, you should expect some dispositions and taking advantage of the market that is there today. As Danny said, you should expect some of the forward contracts that we've taken to be issued all on a modest basis, all with a balanced approach to that. I'm not surprising you with one way to fund this Company, but with that we're using all the tools we got available."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Haendel St. Juste Okay. And then I don't know if I missed this, you talked about the $25 million of signed, but not leased rent. Did you talk about what proportion of that will likely hit or is embedded in your 2022 guidance? I'm looking at [Indiscernible]"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood A big chunk of that number will hit in 22? I would say that 90% of the income from those leases, will happen in the fourth quarter, and over the balance of 2022."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Haendel St. Juste Okay. Percentage rents if I could sneak one more in here, I guess how they performed in the quarter perspectives are big, a pickup versus prior quarters. Any thoughts on that into year-end here?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood Yes, no. Strong and significantly better than we thought. There’re 2 components to it. First, is there are -- there is percentage rent on deals that were not adjusted during COVID. They have natural or unnatural breakpoints betting on how it contracts its RIN and sales have been high. So just there's a natural component to percentage rent that is better than the others. And then as I think we talked about in the past, there have been -- some of our COVID deals effectively traded out; fixed rent for a low  point of percentage rent, so that we were sharing the recovery, if you will, with the prospective tenants. The recovery has been stronger. And so, percentage rent on those COVID adjusted deals were higher. So, I think what we have $4.9 million in the quarter. When you think about $5 million, will be 5 million times 4, $20 million for the year? No, it won't. This was -- it was a really good quarter and some of those deals in percentage rent will convert back to fixed rent deal. Just by the very nature of the contract, it won't be as strong in that particular number going forward. But I am hopeful that's helpful. In either case, it's because sales were higher than we thought they would be."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Haendel St. Juste No, I understood. Understood. And certainly, appreciate the color on the sales. The adjustments you made in the leases, is that going to be for the next year, 2 years, or when do they go back to more traditional?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood Most of them are done in '22, I think 1 or 2 will ma ke their way into '23."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ki Bin Kim , Don. . Just going back to your acquisition. Your basis value per square foot was pretty low and I know that was negotiated during COVID, but even if you market to market is still pretty low basis, so I was just curious, I know you could mention IRR, but what's the real estate strategy behind your acquisition?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood You are right, keeping to look at one of the components we look at, and that's price per acre. Because at the end of the day, what you get in at, will help determine what it is that you can make work, in terms highest and best use. And so, when you look at something like Grossmont, price per acre is really important to us because we're not sure of exactly which way we can go. But because of a price we've got in it, we've got multiple ways to go. And that's when you really think about creating value it really often comes down to the flexibility. To show we have an idea, and then often something gets in the way of that idea; whether your choices. And so, I don't want to say that price per acre is not important. It's really important. And obviously, when you get the highest and best use, you try to figure out what your IRR will be as you go through. That going in price is probably the most important factor in determining what it is that you can do."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ki Bin Kim Yeah.  for that color. And it is interesting because you're seeing different reasons, take different strategies and -- it'll be dumb to say just low basis is good. Obviously want to smart deals and put smart capital to work. But it is something I noticed that your basis is just low on a lot of these deals. Anyway, on second question on development, what is the likelihood of adding a 4thproject to your big 3? And does the fact that just the cost to develop is so high, and if you do it and get started then you're basically locking in a higher rent that you need to justify it. Does that hold you back from adding a 4th grand project?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood Well, so I would say the chance of having a big 4, a 4th project, are less than 50-50. They're not 0, they're not even 20%, but it's less than 50-50, and there's a number of reasons for that. The single biggest reason is everything has to be looked at through our risk-adjusted prism. And when you look at the big 3, it's funny because we've been doing the big 3 for so long, everybody loves to say, Okay, what's the next? But if you work here and you would try to figure out where you want to put capital incrementally to create the most value. Time and time again, you will come down to the big 3 because we're not close to being done. And so, the notion of adding incremental building to Santana Row, Pike & Rose, and Assembly Row, just kills the comparison with starting another mixed-use property that will take two decades to do. It always comes down to capital allocation and where your alternatives are and what the smartest thing to do is. And then I think the mistake that some investors and analysts make are underestimating the level of growth and capital that is still yet to come at the Big Three, some 10, 15, the case of Santana, 20 years later."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paulina Rojas-Schmidt . Your tenant collectability impact includes $5 million in rent abatements. I'm curious, what type of tenants are still receiving these abatements? Then how much longer do you think they will need it? And 3, are these really rent abatements or these are deferrals that you are writing off?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood Paulina, I want to say one thing about that right now. You asked a question; how long do you think they'll need it? That's irrelevant because these are deals that were cut. They were cut in the middle of COVID. They were cut to expire with expiration dates at some point either in 2021 or in 2022, and a couple just because negotiating got us to 2023. They actually don't need it any longer. And that's why you see percentage rent the way you see it, middle of setting that abatement. And it was smart that we were able to switch off an abatement for a fixed rent for percentage rent because we are getting paid. It's just in a different line than you see it there. I just want to make sure you know. These are contracts that were agreed to previously that have sunset dates on them. The end of this year, some in '22 and a couple in '23. That number will bill -- burn down over the course of 2022."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paulina Rojas-Schmidt That's very helpful, I wasn't fully aware of that. And then are you able to share the same corporate NOI growth implied in your FFO guidance for next year, even if it's a wide range, it will be helpful."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dan Guglielmone Yeah, we're going to provide that detailed, comprehensive assumptions in our guidance for next year. Just guessing it's probably in and around 3% for next year. This year while we don't think it's relevant, should come in in double-digits, low double-digits blended for the year. But I think this year it's somewhat irrelevant. Next year we'll give you a detail ed assumption on same -- comparable property growth on the February call."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Mike Mueller Hi. A couple of quick ones here. How much quarterly hotel and parking NOI are you guys getting today? And what do you see is a more normalized level for that?
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Dan Guglielmone Let's go one question at a time. I'm not -- you're going to get them.
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dan Guglielmone Help me out here. It's roughly the run rate right now, parking income is about $2.5 million a quarter. And given that -- that should stay -- that's probably at about 70% to 75% of a stabilized run rate. And then hotels are not going to contribute this year. And so, we should see that it's only gravy as they increase. We've seen the scale in the list. Couple of months, kind of a real resurgence in our occupancy levels at the 3 hotels that we have. So, we're really optimistic that they will start to contribute in '22 and certainly in '23 and '24 portfolios."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Mueller Got it. Okay. And then, Dan, when you were talking to you about prior-period rents not recurring, was that a comment when you're talking about 2021 guidance in 2022, you're not booking anything at the same level as to what you saw in 2023 or you just have 0 in for prior period on everything going forward?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dan Guglielmone I don't have 0. No, I will give some guidance on 2022 in February. This year, we've been pretty consistently in the $7 million to $10 million range. Started out high in the third quarter of last year, and it's been about $7 million to $8 million the last 3 quarters. I don't think we can sustain that. So that should start coming down just based upon on what's outstanding in terms of our build accounts receivable. And so, it should come down pretty meaningfully, certainly in 2022 from the levels we've had this year."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Linda Tsai Hi. Just have one question. Do you have big picture thoughts on how companies are utilizing office space differently coming out of COVID, based on what you're seeing in your own portfolio, or any anecdotes to share?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood You know Linda, all I would say is -- and I just did an interview for the Washington Business Journal around the Choice deal. And the -- we are se eing pretty consistently in our places and again, it's a small sample size. But most people are looking for less space. And from where they are to where they're going. And I guess I'm not saying anything so eye-opening there. But it's been pretty consistent and equally consistent is obviously the ones we're talking to are putting a very high-value on the amenity base environment in buildings that are brand-new. And so, when you put those two things to gether, we're not getting frankly, the rent pressure, partly because I think it's -- the total rent that they're paying is not more than they were paying before because they are taking less space. And so interestingly, the biggest component of where they're going, and almost all have some kind of a hybrid work model associated with is that partly allows them to take less of space. But they're unyielding with respect to what amenity base means, and the frankly newness of the building."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Linda Tsai Do they also want shorter lease terms too?
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood But again, just remember Linda, you're not talking to a guy with a lot of office knowledge throughout the country. We're talking about really San Jose, California, here in outside of Washington D.C., and outside of Boston, and that's it."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tammi Fique . . I'm just wondering in terms of the acquisitions in the pipeline, I'm wondering if you could talk about where you are looking to expand geographically going forward. Particularly given the recent acquisitions in Phoenix. And then as a follow-up, do you think that there is an advantage to geographic portfolio concentrations in your business, where given that you have been pretty concentrated historically? ."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood Tammi, I just want to add that something what Jeff said, which I couldn't agree with more all way through. You can't really -- you cannot underestimate that when you're a player in a market, how prospective sellers, or people that are not even sellers, but might be sellers, will view you, how they'll come to you? How you'll see things that you wouldn't see? It's so different than just owning one or two properties in a very wide place because obviously, our business -- this business is local. And the best example we have that just happened is effectively what's going on in Phoenix. I mean, we are talking -- the inbound questions along with our own work in Phoenix has quadrupled from what it would have been when -- if we had just bought 1 or 2 very small properties. By owning Camelback Colonnade, we're a player. It's well-known. And what -- you can't underestimate how that can lead to more work. And certainly, on the retailer side and on the operational side, you get your obvious efficiencies and disproportionate level of play. We've seen that in Washington, DC, in suburban Maryland forever. We're now starting to see it in Northern Virginia. because we've made such a play there. There's no doubt in my mind that concentration is a really big plus in this business. And no more so than on the acquisition side."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tammi Fique .  for that perspective. And then I guess just following up on collections question, just to be clear. You expect a majority of those tenants to start paying full rent again and not get results during move-outs. Is that the right way to think about it?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Dan Guglielmone Can you repeat that again? You flooded in and out.
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tammi Fique Sorry about that. I was just saying on the collections question, I just wanted to be sure it was clear, that you expect a majority of the tenants in that 4% number to start paying full rent again and not get resolved through move-outs. Is that correct?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood I think some will be resolved. I think some will be kicked out. Ri ght. We're down to the last 3% to 4% of tenants, and we are obviously have taken a much stronger position with them. We are not in COVID as an economy anywhere near the extent we were obviously. And so, to the extent those businesses can survive in the existing business and going forward, maybe they don't belong here. A nd so we're taking a harder line on that side. With respect to the balance. We certainly expect to get paid and will. I'm not -- I don' t -- the difference between 96% and 99.3%, I don't know whether it's 1/2 and 1/2of those choices or 2/3 and 1/3, but it's something like that."

4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood I thought we're going around the circle again, but no, sir, what can I do for you?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Bilerman I'm not going to ask you for drivers of 2023 and 2024 guidance. So, don't worry about that, but you did give us '21 and '22. So, I really appreciate that you guys came around and provided that to the investment community. So, . I wanted to ask 2 questions. One, just one on Summer Ville. Joe has put out some revised and updated plans for what he wants to see at Assembly, I guess how close could we be to that next phase and incorporating the power center into a larger project? And I know you talked about the big 3, the gifts that keep on giving, it feels like this is closer now, but I wanted to get your sense of where things stand."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood I don't think that the power center conversion to Assembly Row 9.0 or wherever it would be at that point is imminent, so I don't want you to think about it that way. It is obvious when you think about the long -term highest and best use of any piece of property, given what's happened at Assembly Row. And eventually, one day there should be intensification on the power center site. But it is years and years away. I don't -- heck, you won't pay me for '23 for Pete's sake, never mind whenever that's going to happen at that asset. But forgetting about that, look at the rest of Assembly Row. Look at the space between Partners HealthCare and our existing property and what happens to them. And it is -- we are looking very hard at life sciences sale, as you can imagine. And to the extent we can get the economics to make some sense at all. Obviously construction costs are the biggest hurdle in that. But given what's happened to the adjacent properties, it's really clear to us that the assembly site at -- in Somerville, is going to be a life sciences site at some point. Whether it's just the adjacencies or whether it includes us, will depend on whether we can make the numbers work or not. But that you should -- that is far more imminent certainly than the power center site."
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Bilerman And then just thinking about -- trigger over your enthusiasm, I don't want to curb your enthusiasm at all, but I guess how do you sit back? It's been a pretty strange 2 years. And so how are you able to distinguish that all the things that are happening now are not just sort of a little bit of a catch-up, from just being out of the market for a while? And not taking what's happening right now on all the leasing and activity and everyone's excited and we're getting back out and we're having meals and dinners and bar mitzvahs and weddings. How do you not take it to not get ahead of yourself in terms of where it goes?"
4465769,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,11/5/2021,CEO Don Wood on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Don Wood I love that question, man, because you're basically talking to a very conservative guy. In terms of those, I worry about everything going forward all the time. In this case the thing that gives me confidence, and it's a lot of confidence, is I am sure that what we own and where it is, is really valuable. And so, it's like the office side, we may be over office in this country now. We talked about being over retail wherever, we may be over office. But Federal Realty is it, because where we have that office and what is being built in terms of that office, if there's any office at all. It's going to be -- That demand is going to be at places like this that we own. I feel the same way on the retail. And so, where you hear confidence from me, you don't hear confidence that everything is  in the world is going to stay  in the world. I just know on a relative basis, whatever is happening, we've got the right products. And that's where my -- that's where my confidence comes from."

First, can you separate organic growth in China lab versus industrial? And within China, are you seeing any changes competitive dynamics emerge, coming out of the pandemic within China, and if there's any market share opportunities that look different, pre -COVID versus post COVID?"
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Patrick Kaltenbach Well, right Shawn. If I may have a little flavor here is for both businesses for lap and for industrial business. Open investments in lab is really driven by investments in new lab, and investments in research that we see in China. And that's a very healthy business for us. So I think our team is exceptionally well-positioned to serve that market. We follow products that we have high end as well as local products will be manufactured in China. I think we have the right portfolio to really continue to see growth in the lab side as well. And on industrial, the demand in China is actually not similar from what we see in the rest of the world. There is a lot of demand in -- for automation and productivity solutions, and with our industry solutions, especially new products that we have launched, like the industry's 360 turnover, etc. We are extremely well-positioned to help our customers to drive productivity in automation and we see -- what I hear -- what I'm hearing from China is that that demand will not continue to slow down. They continue to upgrade installed systems and they are looking for ways to become more productive."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Eric Chung . That's helpful. And to pivot to the product inspection business, and I think it's been about a year or so since you got step up and ru nning at the Tampa product inspection site, and that was something you guys saw as a driver of operational efficiency when you talked about it. How is that translated into recognize benefits this year and are you seeing any concerns in that business over the next quarter given the Delta variant emergence in the U.S. along with rising cases in China?"
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,Kevin Cassidy Hi. This is Kevin on for Vijay. Looking at guidance for 2022. Can you talk to the pricing assumptions behind guide? And what is being implied for operating margin expansion in 2022?
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Shawn Vadala Yes. Sure. Kevin, I'll take that one. So for pricing for next year, we're kind of targeting something in the 3% a range. Of course we acknowledge we're not in an inflationary environment, and so we'll adjust as necessary as we proceed into the year. And then when we look at our operating margin expansion, we expect to be in the 100 basis point range on top of this year. And when you start to compound that on a multi-year basis, we feel particularly good about that. If you look at this year, will be a 120 basis points higher than the previous year. So we continued to deliver at the higher end of our long-term guidance of 7200 basis points. We fe el very good about our various margin expansion initiatives, pricing, as well as our Stern Drive program. But at the same time, we acknowledge there's also a lot of challenges out in the world in terms of material cost, and transportation costs that we talked about in our prepared remarks."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin Cassidy And the follow-up. Looking at food in the quarter being down 19%, can you talk more about the segment and outlook going forward?"
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Shawn Vadala So food retailing was down 19% in the quarter. That business, as you know, is a business that we manage for profitability and not necessarily for growth overall, it's only about 5% of our total business. That business can be lumpy impacted by the timing of project or customer orders. At the same time that business out of all of our businesses was the one that was negatively impacted by some component shortages because we use common electronics components in our retail scales that are also used in certain consumer products. We expect, going forward, to be down similarly in the fourth quarter, But then for 2022, we don't expect much growth in the business, probably up low single-digit. And as I always say, if you look at that business over a longer-term period of time, it's just probably a low single-digit business, but it will be lumpy every now and then from quarter-to-quarter."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Elizabeth Hi, guys. This is Elizabeth, on for Patrick. I'm just wondering, You guys talk a little bit about inflation in general. I was wondering if you could talk about internally, if that's affecting wages and what you're seeing in labor in general. ."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Shawn Vadala Yes. So, in terms of wage inflation, we're going to experience higher wage inflation. I think like every Company in the world, there's certainly -- it's a competitive labor market in all parts of the world. As we look at our cost structure for next year, our overall cost structure will go up about 4% or so. And of course, wages are a significant component of our overall cost structure. But if you look at it. By geography, of course it's going to be highly differentiated based upon local labor markets."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Nisarg Shah Hey, . This is Nisarg on for Jack. To start, the lab segment performed well despite supply chain challenges, are you expecting heightened impact here in the fourth quarter?"
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,Patrick Kaltenbach Can you repeat it? Can we expect -- sorry we didn't get it. Can -- what was the question?
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,Nisarg Shah Sorry. The lab segment performed well despite supply chain challenges in the third quarter. Are you expecting a heightened impact in the fourth quarter?
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Patrick Kaltenbach Okay. I can take a is. Sorry, we didn't get that part about supply chain. Now, look, all that -- the business, actually we don't really expect a bigger impact in the fourth quarter and you have seen in Q3. It is a very dynamic situation as I say out there. Both in trends -- and logistics on the material supply side -- for the products we have in lap. You will notice, exposed as we are in the retail business. So we are not already concerned for the lab business. Dare to be honest."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Derik De Bruin Hey. . I've been bouncing around between calls, so my apologies if I'm being redundant here. But how do you think about any of your digital marketing and campaigns, and your field turbo and some of the other ones where you put a lot of feet on the street, and now those costs are expanding and it's like, is there a higher return now or emphasis on pushing more into the electronic and digital? I guess, how much of those efforts can -- how much more do you need to spend on building out electronic -- your e-commerce capabilities and such versus hiring people? Yeah."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Patrick Kaltenbach . That's an excellent question. Looking in its -- it's a really , but you have to look at it also from 2 different angles and you mentioned both the digital closures as well as to fuel tubular. We see a lot of demand at the end as well, and widely, actually invested quite a bit this year and fuel tours have made significant investments there and putting more fleet industry because we saw demand, and that actually it's paying back very quickly for us is  returns. And on the digital side, we continue  to be mobile to ensure engine overall that it's some marketing engine that its direct sales engine, etc. We have very effective on that. It has been at has also provided for us  returns. And we will always have both -- we oversee both approach. We have a direct consolidate Salesforce, which is in the accremate with customers. For our very dedicated higher end products, etc. that also need more consolidated selling. And then, we have -- we continue to build out our digital capabilities to serve more transactional sales and continue to strengthen our digital marketing capabilities. I think this year we did a significant number of more [Indiscernible] and other things to interact with customers, which has been extremely well received. It's a  tool for us to increase leads despite all the things that we do on -- so we are -- again, I think we are very well positioned, we made  strides forward during the pandemic and actually accelerate a lot of investments and we see  returns on that. Again, I'm always looking at a business. I'm monitoring a number of fleets that are generated by these capabilities, and we are very pleased of how well they perform and how well they are received by the customers."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Brandon Couillard . . There really is a small acquisition, small software deal in Third Quarter, but any material revenue, it is tied to that. touch on whether that fill the whole of the portfolio and kind of your thoughts on appetite for similar type of bolt-on deals."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Patrick Kaltenbach What's the question specifically? What type of revenues are linked to -- sorry, look, a software Company requires Scale Up System is not a large Company, but it compliments on our portfolio in AutoChem specifically very well. We are a very strong player in AutoChem that business has been growing double-digit for a long time now. We are extremely pleased with that. And we certainly see the combination of our existing portfolio together with this new software capabilities that require that we continued to serve -- can serve our customers and additional customers much better in the future. We will have a much better reach into regions where Scale Up Systems couldn't go with [Indiscernible] force. I think it's a very well-received solution by the customers. And then we have received also very positive feedback by the existing customers with Scale Up Systems on the acquisition overall. They see that 1 out of 1 perform actually equals more than 2 in this regard. So -- and then to your other part, in terms -- the other part of the question here is in terms of bolt-on acquisitions. Yeah, we will continue down that line. We've mentioned that I think in every call that we continue to make bolt-on acquisitions in -- either in technologies area -- technology areas, where we see we need technologies that complement our strength or if it's other parts of the portfolio that we think are necessary in terms of the overall customer workflows. But these are small and me dium-size acquisitions and nothing huge transformation."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Brandon Couillard . Shawn, it would be helpful if you could walk us through, change your top-line assumptions by segment for next year, and be able to quantify the impact of the lower demand on lap growth next year?"
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Shawn Vadala Yes. Sure. Hey, maybe I'll start with the lab business, and you want me to do Q4 as well as next year, Brandon?"
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Shawn Vadala . Hey, I'll just run through this for everybody. For lab -- for Q4, we're looking at low double-digit which would put us in a 20% growth range for the full year. And then for next year, we look at high single-digit for lab for core Industrial. We're looking at high single-digit for Q4, which would put us at mid to high teens for the full year. And then for next year, we would be more like low to mid-single-digit. For product inspection, we'd be high single-digit for Q4, which would put us at high single-digit for the full year and also high single-digit for 2022. For food retailing, we're looking at a similar decline in Q4 to what we saw in Q3, which would put us down mid to high single-digit for the full year and then for next year, we'd be looking at low single-digit growth. By geography, we're looking at Europe to be low to mid-single-digit in Q4, which would be put us at low double-digit growth for the full year. For next year, we're looking at low to mid-single-digit growth. For the Americas, we're looking at low double-digit growth in Q4, which would put us at mid-teens for the full year. And then for next year, we're looking at mid-single-digit growth. And then for China, we have -- we're looking at low double-digit growth in Q4 which would put us in -- to the mid-20s for the full year. And for next year, we're looking at approximately 10% growth. And then in terms of the other part of your question -- in terms of the COVID testing headwinds that we would have next year, that would be -- it would be a slight headwind. I think it would be probably less than 1%. I don't know if it will quite round to 1%, but it would be a modest headwind next year. That's our baseline assumption."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Josh Waldman Hi, guys,  for taking my question. I appreciate all the detail on the outlook. Just two for you, I guess. First, a quick follow-up on Product Inspection, wondering if you could, I guess provide more context on what you're seeing from an orders and quoting activity. I mean, it sounds like the U.S. was strong. What are you seeing in other geographies? And then as you look forward, I mean, it seems like there's a bit of cautious optimism in the commentary, but the high single-digit seems pretty strong here based on the comp from 2021. Just any more detail on kind of what’s giving you confidence for next year would be helpful."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Patrick Kaltenbach Yes. , Sir Josh. So, product inspections is that we're very pleased with the current quarter Shawn that -- Dave just gave it to you. The growth for Q4, how we think about that high-single-digits. We see demand in the Americas. We see putting models on Europe. China, again, has momentum as well. I mentioned that we have launched a new product there just a quarter ago. Overall, there is some pent-up demands, the pent-up demands for being more superseding, including more in the U.S. and if I look at the older situation as well as the leads we're getting, there's actually pretty high lead activity right now. We see a lot of requests both from Europe and U.S. but they're even higher than in Europe. But having said that, we are again, cautiously optimistic about 2020, that we can capture that pent-up demand. We're well positioned for our product portfolio, and also we are -- in terms of our manufacturing capabilities, I think we are operating very well and very effective. We have not seen a lot of impact on supply chain side for that product line. So, in terms of exposure to semiconductors and components, etc. it's not as exposed to as we mentioned it for retail."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Josh Waldman Got it. . And then I wondered if you could give us an update on what portion of your revenue now is coming from bio production, I guess, in light of some of the recent acquisitions, thinking PendoTECH. And then maybe what's built into your assumptions for 2022 from that business."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Shawn Vadala Yeah sure. So overall, we don't have a precise number on that, Josh, but we typically like to say that overall life sciences in total is about a third of our business. I think knowledge is probably a bit more than that right now just given some of the acquisitions we've done in the last few years in the high growth we've had in that area. And then a few breaks that down into pieces, of course, large molecule in general is an important piece of that, and then bio-production in particular is also an important part of that. If you like it, just the pieces of bio-production, the area that we benefit the most would be in our process analytics business, which is probably in the 10% range of our total business, maybe a little bit more in an important part of product -- of process analytics is in bio-production. But of course we also sell Industrial scales in other appli cations into the bio-production environment as well."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Rachel Hi. This is Rachel in for Tycho. s. So you said service and consumables was up 12% in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the trends that you're seeing within both of those. Currently, I think consumables was roughly about 10% of revenue and services is about 20%. What's your long-term goal for each of those? And then could you also just touch on, how are you competing against third-party service providers? ."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Patrick Kaltenbach Very  there. Looking at -- is it extremely pleased with the performance of service and consumables events, very profitable part of the business for us. In terms of growth rate for services think about it, [Indiscernible] maybe high. It could times high-single-digit, more mid-single-digits growth rate. Consumables is higher right now. We are -- who is continuing to grow that portfolio moving forward both on the consumable side for our products, but we're also increasingly providing higher-value services for our products. And I mentioned the 1, for example, for the Europe Pharmacopoeia there's a solution out there that we just launched. That is, I think we have a lot of opportunities for installed base of products that we have out there to increase service contracts overall and to provide more differentiated services to our customers. We serve a lot of our products. But as of course, also competition in some areas, like the Scale areas. We -- I think we're positioning ourselves also in the future by providing higher sophisticated services, preventive maintenance and other things, have very comprehensive inventory management as well, solutions as well. So, very optimistic about accrued opportunity. Again, we are very, very well-positioned in terms of the competitive position. As we are also linking our software solution, so a hardware solutions and services. And that makes it more difficult for competitors also, take over some of the services that they all can exclusively provide some of mobile products."
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,Q,"Matt Sykes Hey, everybody.  for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Just one question for me. Big picture question. Just looking at Stern Drive is sort of a program and how institutionalize that is become and how successful that has been over the years and the iterative process and productivity enhancements it gives you. I am just wondering, looking at this current environment just with inflation supply chain constraints, we just really haven't seen something like this in a number of years. Has it caused you to think differently about how you implement certain driver-driven aspects of it, has it made you think about different ways you can implement it, or different levers you can pull, just given the change in the environment that we've seen from a cost and supply chain constraint perspective?"
4465771,Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,MTD,11/5/2021,CEO Patrick Kaltenbach on Q3 2021 Results - Earning Call Transcript,A,"Patrick Kaltenbach Yeah. . Stern Drive has many flavors, it's back-office automation ideas, it's manufacturing setup ideas, it's -- in some areas, it's product redesign, and the -- it's a program that has been running for many years, and the team is actually going through several waves of Stern Drive, we call it internally waves. We just launched the next wave this year. The team has come up with a whole -- a long list of good ideas that we just recently had order fulfillment top-line chain showed us the potential of all these activities. We had some concerns this year that our stern-drive activities could be impacted actually, by all the other activities given -- that weren't that necessary, given the restrictions we have seen the market logistic challenges etc. But I'm happy to say the team didn't skip a beat there and they actually delivered on the promised savings that they had promised us for 2021 as well, which helps to overcome some of the inflationary pressures. Now, do we make a significant shift in terms of the activities given the lock to see challenges right now? I would say no, because again, they're very focused on productivity gains sometimes, product 3D signs, driving productivity and efficiency. Behalf on the supply chain side, we have a dedicated team in place who take us all the other logistical challenges Almost look [Indiscernible] slides like shipments and shipping alternatives, etc. Access to different suppliers when it comes to components, we have dedicated resources who constantly screened a market for best opportunities for supply. I think this is also why we probably came through this crisis so far very well, not having a lot of issues with component shortages, except for retail that we mentioned. But not often we also use semiconductors, I think the team has been very effective in finding alternatives and also working closely, with the internal engineering teams in case we would have to redesign products and use alternative products. But I think it's working very well. I mean, it was a long winded answer, but overall we are big extremely pleased with stern drive. I think it's still a lot of fun way, be driving this with constant improvement, process mindset. And again, they have dedicated teams in all of our major slides who capture these opportunities."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dan Brennan . . I thought for the first question, I would want to begin on the outlook for the fourth quarter. After a really strong start to the year, you're raising guidance. But the fourth-quarter looks to be conservative to us. And I'm just wondering a couple of things here. Is there anything implied further for COVID testing? I know you had $25 million to $30 million per quarter originally in your guidance, so the [Indiscernible] to the strong COVID here in Q3. And given the easy comp and given the backlog and the momentum, I am just wondering why the fourth quarter outlook might not be stronger. And then I have a follow-up. ."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Sam Samad Yes. , Dan this is Sam and hope you're doing well. Welcome back and good to have you on the call. So, for Q4, first of all, let me talk about the full year. We are as we talked about on the prepared remarks, Dan, we are raising our revenue guide to approximately 36%. For Q4, I think there's a couple of areas that you need to keep in mind. One is the conclusion of the UK Biobank initiatives. This has been an incredibly productive, incredibly, I would say, very important initiative from a population genomics standpoint that we talked a little bit about the outcomes from that and the next steps. But that's will likely present $20 million quarter-to-quarter headwind or reduction in terms of revenues in Q4 versus Q3. So that's one area. And then the second area, and I think you touched on that in your question with regards to COVID surveillance. So COVID surveillance has been strong for the year, we've seen obviously, with the continue -- with the pandemic, the way it is. But there's continued testing and sequencing of positive samples across the globe. For Q3, we have $55 million of COVID surveillance revenue in the quarter, that represented $15 million of instruments and $40 million of consumables. For Q4, our expectation is that we will have $35 million of COVID surveillance revenue, which represents a modest amount of instrument revenues, about $5 million, and then approximately $30 million of COVID consumables. That represents, again, another $20 million reduction from Q3 into Q4. When we think about that sequential momentum, the core business is really strong, and when I say the core business, I mean our clinical business, research business, you heard comments from Bob around GRAIL, but there is that reduction associated with those two items, which is COVID surveillance as well as the UK Biobank concluding."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dan Brennan . And then in terms of clinical, Francis, and therapy selection, you gave a lot of color there, you talked about customers rapidly adding platforms. Could you give us a sense of, I don't know if you have this information, but the install base that's supporting this customer base? What that's been growing at and what's the backlog look like and outlook for further growth in that area? ."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bob Ragusa Yeah. , Dan and I'll add my welcome to account, and it's  to see you covering us again. So, I did talk a lot about the strength in the oncology segment, specifically oncology therapy selection testing because that really has been one of the breakout stories, frankly, for the whole year. And what's really driving that story is a few things. 1. We saw a significant expansion in reimbursement for genomic testing for therapy selection play out in the U.S., and so now we have a significant base in the U.S. that has coverage for genomic testing. And at the same time, we've seen a move towards larger panels as Comprehensive Genomic Profiling really gets traction in the market. And so those two have created a powerful force and oncology therapy selection testing. And we're seeing our customers expanding their fleets. Now in terms of how that's playing out, you're seeing it play out across all segments. You're seeing some of our larger customers significantly expanding their fleets and expanding their Novaseq fleet specifically, because of the demand that they're seeing, as well as the anticipated demand going forward. But you're also seeing new customers and some are smaller customers get into oncology therapy selection. One of the interesting messages to look at and it takes into account more than oncology, but I'd say oncology is one of the biggest drivers of it, is if you look at the strength in the NovaSeq instruments, you'd see we're placing a lot of NovaSeq instruments and we're having a very strong backlog of NovaSeq instruments. And at the same time, you're seeing really strong pull-through in NovaSeq. And so, that's sort of the pot of gold at the end of the double rainbow, right? Because you're seeing -- you're putting a lot of instruments out there and yet pull-through remains high end, the high end of the range we've talked about. And so, to your question about what's the outlook going forward, I'd say that's a really good positive indicator for what people is experiencing today, and what they are expecting going forward."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vijay Kumar Hey, guys. Congrats on a good print here and  for taking my question. I had one question on the implied Q4 guidance in fiscal '22. The upda ted EPS guidance of $5.50 to $5.60, that implies about I think $0.30 to $0.40 in Q4, are there -- is there -- is that Q4 -- do you have some one-off costs or is that something abnormal happening? Because that's an annualized run rate of $1.60. I don't think that sounds right. I just want to make sure I have that Q4 assumption right. And for fiscal 2021, should comps matter because most of your peers are assuming normalized growth. And given your comments around backlog, I understand we have surveillance being a bit component this year, but that 36% should comps matter and how should we think about it?"
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Sam Samad Yes. So let me start by talking about Q4, Vijay, and we did talk about EPS guide of $0.35 to $0.45, non-GAAP EPS for Q4, including the effects of GRAIL. As I talked about it on the call, there are in Q4 -- there's $0.80 roughly of dilution a dollar for the year, but in Q4, about $0.80 related to GRAIL dilution. And then there is about $0.09 of dilution related to the weighted average share count as a result of the shares that we issued to finance the GRAIL acquisition. Those are specific to GRAIL that obviously impacts with $0.35 to $0.45 non-GAAP EPS for Q4. In terms of the core Illumina business, I talked to -- to answer Dan's question, I talked a little bit about a couple of dynamics around revenues. In terms of Opex, yes, there are some costs that I also mentioned in our prepared remarks. First of all, we have timing of expenses that shifted from Q3 to Q4, that's why Q3 was lower than our expectations in terms of operating expenses. Q4 and now has increased in terms of our expectations for spent there and then I talked about also partnership Opex that is expected in Q4. So, we do have some expenditures associated with certain partnerships that somewhat significance in Q4, that's discrete to Q4. In terms of 2022 guidance, we're not going to talk about guidance on this call, except to say the fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong. We have talked before about the GRAIL dilution of $3.25 to $3.75 for 2022. That remains the case. That has not changed. But as you heard the backlog is very strong. In terms of instruments and the core fundamentals in terms of clinical and research are exceptionally strong."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vijay Kumar I'm sorry, just one clarification, Sam. The $3.25 to $3.75 dilution from GRAIL, that is not incremental, right? You guys have taken a $1.15 of dilution in fiscal '21. So, the $3.25 to $3.75, that is inclusive of the $1.15?"
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Sam Samad That's total dilution for GRAIL in 2022. That's not incremental, that’s the total dilution that we expect, $3.25 to $3.75 impact on non-GAAP EPS in 2022."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tycho Peterson . Sam, I want to hone in on your supply chain comments a little bit. It sounds like limited disruption up till now. We have heard about customers not being able to get flow sales and limited NovaSeq shipments, and you did exit the quarter with record backlog. So, can you maybe just touch on the supply chain dynamics now, given the low tele graft, well publicized shortages of semis, but also cameras and high adoptables?"
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bob Ragusa Yeah. So, the only thing I would add to that, , Francis is that the backlog is really strong  and driven by the demand. All of those things that Francis mentioned are actions that we've taken to ensure there's continuity and the supply chain. And we're fulfilling customer orders on time. There have been I would say, a few isolated customer instances where there have been extensions of lead time which is normal. That's very much something that we see every quarter. But in general, the backlog is really driven by demand, it's not driven by any supply issues that are causing that. . We now have a question on  the line from Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley. Tejas, please go ahead."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tejas Savant Hey, guys. . I have a quick question on GRAIL. Francis, do you have any updates from the regulators now that they've had some time to digest your decision to close? Have you heard anything from them on the structure of the whole separate agreement and the possibility of the fine? And then secondly, can you just lay out your plans to build out the commercial infrastructure here, now that Galleri is live and you started to see early traction from the Mayo Clinic and some of the other partners you highlighted in the prepared remarks?"
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Francis Desouza Ye. Maybe I'll just add one other thing just from a personal perspective. We've rolled out the GRAIL test to Illumina employees. As I know, some of you listening may also have. And again, as a CEO, there are a few times in your career to get to roll out something that's university beloved annuals will save you money. And we started to see since the first people come and reach out to us and say that they've been able to -- they feel fortunate they've been able to find an early-stage cancer because of the Gallery tests. And the cancers they're talking about are ones that don't have other screens. And so, this is a personal realization of the power of this test. . We now have a question from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. So, Patrick, please go ahead when you are ready."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Patrick Donnelly Hey, guys. s. Francis, maybe one on China. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? There is obviously a lot of noise in different parts of the market and you guys put a pretty good result. Can you talk about the trends there you're seeing and expectations going forward?"
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Francis Desouza Yeah. We have continued to see a really strong performance out of China. We, overall, had 47% year-over-year growth. The growth in China continues to be driven by the clinical markets. And so, our strategy, starting last year, of really focusing on the emerging hospital market is really paying dividends. It's a market that's really embracing not just NIPT, which they embraced early, but increasingly also starting to more broadly roll out oncology testing, genomic testing. And so, we're seeing progress there. A lot of it is driven by the terrific partner ecosystem that we've built up over the years in China. That's really paying off. In addition, we're actually seeing a tailwind associated with some regulations that have emerged that allow the use LDTs in Shanghai. And so that has been -- that's fairly recent, but as already started to pay dividends, as we see more labs being stood up to generate their own LDT testing capability. And so that's helped us driving some of the tailwind there. But we're definitely excited and optimistic about what's happening in China for us right now."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Patrick Donnelly Okay. And then maybe one on the population sequencing, you obviously called out UK Biobank concluded this quarter. Can you just update us on how you're feeling about those rolling out? And again, as we see some data and see the use of UK Biobank potential for that to become a bigger piece for you guys?"
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Francis Desouza Yeah, absolutely. One of the  things that is really  to see is the broadening of the base of population sequencing customers. So, we talked about the fact that we've been cultivating over 50 of these opportunities, and we're now at the stage where over 30 of these opportunities are already generating revenue. So that's really good to see from a diversification perspective, which also really  about it is a lot of these population sequencing initiatives are driven as from a national health perspective. So, they aren't research projects, what you're seeing is countries embrace genomic testing as part of a standard of care in a healt h system. And that's terrific, first of all, because of the human impact it allows you to have because you're in the pathway of delivering valuable information to patients. But it also is a place that's very durable, so it means once you are built into the healthcare system, then you just get ramped up to population scales and it goes year-after-year. And so that's another really exciting thing to see. The other thing that's playing out is, we're starting to see the emergence of cohorts, a lot of them involving pharma partners, that are looking to generate data from -- population level data from some of the big data repositories out there around the world like biobanks. And so that's an emerging and then sort of building parts of the population sequencing ecosystem right now too. We now have Derik De Bruin of Bank of America on the line. So, Derik, please go ahead. You may proceed with your question."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Hey, this is my question on for Derik. . Got a couple of quick ones, and I'm just going to focus on sequencing instruments side of the business. You called out really broad strength, [Indiscernible] having NovaSeq, NextSeqDx, 1,000 to 2,000 and the MiSeq. That's pretty much the majority of portfolio. But total sequencing instrument number revenue still declined sequentially. So, I'm just wondering if you could talk to pricing dynamics or an AFT if there's anything unusual going in there mid-year? And then I've got a follow-up on that."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Francis Desouza Yeah, let me reiterate what Sam just said around -- look, we are walking into Q4 having had -- with a record instrument backlog. It's a really strong place to be. We had record instrument shipments in Q3 for NovaSeq and the pull-through on NovaSeq, even with all the instruments we just placed, and you expect a lot of them are still in their ramp up mode, they should be at the low end of pull through. But even with that, the total average pull-through on NovaSeq are the high-end of the range we've talked about. So, it’s in fact there. And so, there's just a lot of activity happening on our NovaSeq South in the field. And that's causing customers to place the orders that are driving the record backlog that we have walking into Q4. And so, we really feel that it's a really fantastically strong position to be. . We now have Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink on the line. Sir Puneet, please go head. When you're ready."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Cooney Sudov , Francis. And . First one on GRAIL, and actually maybe this is for Francis and some for Bob, just in terms of the trials that you have to conduct at this point in time, you mentioned the UK NHS trial ongoing. Obviously, you've committed to GRAIL and taken on the dilution, but in terms of the overall trials that you need that are prospective registrational trial that FDA needs to look at that are prevalence reflecting trials in order to get a screening assay approved on the market, if you could walk us through that. What are you doing to progress towards that? What's the timing of it? What is that trial as you can initiate that trial or is it any other trial or banked samples that you have already collected that you can potentially run and submit that data? I'm just trying to understand in terms of the -- more than 50,000, 100,000 patient trial that is needed in order to get an FDA approval, and then eventually reimbursement and guideline inclusion?"
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bob Ragusa , Francis. Maybe a few other comments on it. Really three key elements driving towards that. 1. The NHS study that we've talked about, with 140,000 participants and then that expanding over the years. So that will provide enormous set of data. We also have the Pathfinder study, which will conclude the middle of next year. And so far, the data to date has shown generally consistent with the early validation data, so that's very, very positive to this point. And then also, reflection -- the gallery reflection registry study where we'll look at the experiencing clinical outcomes of 35,000 screening eligible patients over the age of 50. We were prescribed the test from a healthcare provider, and that enrollment began this quarter, and that will also provide significant data on the marks to reimbursement. Want to amplify also way Francis said there was -- even without reimbursement, there is a tremendous amount of pre -reimbursement activity and pre -reimbursement opportunity for Gallery. And so, while the march to reimbursement is incredibly important, it's not the only factor to look at. . As we are almost out of time, our last question comes from Kyle Mikson of Canaccord. Kyle, please go ahead."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kyle Mikson Hi, s. I just wanted to confirm one thing here on GRAIL. First on timelines, I hope this was alluded to earlier, but the pause in the investigation and it's been resumed that this is in early February now. Honestly, most of these decisions for trials and reviews are kind of expecting first quarter of '22. I just wanted to ask how much clarity will be provided when these events conclude. Obviously, it's been a pretty polarizing topic. I just think it'd be helpful to understand the level of visibility regarding, I guess, the regulatory outcome that you expect to have beyond the first quarter of 22. And just one other thing to tack on here. The GRAIL revenue performance in the quarter, it looks like it was maybe 5 years or so we'll be kind of spread out throughout the 3 months at the annualized $20 million. Just want to understand what the maybe test volume trends are and maybe even reimbursement as well would be helpful. ."
4465773,"Illumina, Inc.",ILMN,11/5/2021,CEO Francis Desouza Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bob Ragusa Yeah, just on the revenue question. So, grow revenue represents both revenues recognized from the sale of our Gallery test, as well as our revenues generated from our MRD collaboration agreements with biopharmaceutical companies. We expect the MRD PDx collaboration income will continue as an important component of gross revenue and as an attractive future growth element of our business. We do expect the mix of the GRAIL pharma MRD revenue components during the early launch phase to be variable from quarter-to-quarter. And so, the overall revenue is not really -- because of the mix of pricing and that the overall revenue is not a real  indicator of sample volume. . As you have no further questions on the time, I will hand it back to Brian Blanchett for some closing remarks. . As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available on the Investors section of our website, as well as through the dial instructions contained in today's earnings release.  for joining us today. This concludes our call and we look forward to our next update following the close of 2021.  again for joining. Today's Illumina Q3 2021 Earnings Call. Today's call has now concluded. You may now disconnect your lines and have a lovely day."
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Wendy Nicholson Hi! My question has to do with how you're thinking about pricing and promotion, because on the one hand you've got strong market shares, it seems like strong demand, yet you've got capacity constraints and supply chain constraints. So on the one hand you want to keep promotion up to keep people coming to your brand, but if you can't service demand how do you balance those two. If you could talk about what you are thinking about just in the short term over the next few months, how you scale up supply and get more bottles on the shelf, more cans on the shelf."
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Hilton Schlosberg Okay Wendy, this is Hilton. That's an excellent question. So we have a department called Revenue Growth Management that balances pricing and balances promotions in line with the expectations that we set for the business and for our brands. So we’ve been working very closely and started in this quarter, in fact slightly before this last quarter in cutting back promotions and using them very judiciously. So we look at this on an ongoing basis. We have plans for 2022 which involves changing retail pricing on shelves, which leads to obesity reduction in promotions and we don't rule out the possibility of a full price increase later on in 2022. But we keep our options open. We prefer to accomplish the objectives through reductions in promotions, but we have to see what the cost environment looks like going into the 2022. Obviously if you haven't got product and you showed a product that doesn't make sense to promote extensively, but we still have to promote in order to fulfill the contract that we've had this year with our customers and our retailers which was set at the beginning of the and so some cannot be changed and as we move into 2020, adjust pricing through promotions and/or price increases. The question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bonnie Herzog Hi! I wanted to ask a little bit further on the points you're making about this, outsized demand and that you weren't able to satisfy this increased demand in the quarter and given the shortages. So is there any you guys could help quantify for us the impact that this had on you top line in both the U.S. and EMEA. I mean I'm just trying to understand is that, you know was it a low single digit impact on growth? Could it have been more like a mid-single digit improvement on your top online."
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Hilton Schlosberg No, no. Is it one question or two?"
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bonnie Herzog Okay, well that’s it. I just want to also understand if the situations improved in Q3 versus Q2."
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Peter Galbo Hey guys! .  for taking the question. I was just wondering Hilton, you know the comments on other pricing actions, you know retail pricing on shelves, potential for a full list price increase. Just can you give us a sense on maybe when you would consider that more thoroughly? Is there a reason why it's not now, is there a shelf reset period that you need to wait for. Just, you know listening to some of the commentary from some of the bottlers, it seems like they are taking pricing now. Just why wait?"
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Astrachan Yes, hey!  guys. Hope all's well . I wanted to ask about the Coke relationship. So the can supply shortages, so me of the manufacturing challenges that you've laid out in recent quarters, assuming distribution disadvantaged verses Red Bull self-distribution at least in the U.S., how do you think about your relationship with Coke, and importantly how does it get better and what makes it better from here."
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andrea Teixeira .  there. I wanted to just go back to the magnitude of pricing in your comments in the last earnings call. That you expect the cost pressures and supply challenge to abate in the fourth quarter. Are you still expecting that to be the case or sequentially quite worse and we should brace for something similar in the fourth quarter against the third quarter. And just for clarification, you said high single digit million cases impact or you said high single digit percentage impact that would have been?"
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Hilton Schlosberg No, well in cases it’s a high, just to be clear it's a high number of cases in millions, in the high single digits."
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Andrea Teixeira And on the pricing Hilton, can you let us know the magnitude that you're trying to put through and how we should think about cogs into the fourth quarter."
4465792,Monster Beverage Corporation,MNST,11/5/2021,CEO Rodney Sacks on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Hilton Schlosberg Right, so if you look at where we are with cogs, it’s really a difficult situation right now, because I don't know where for example aluminum is going. I think those of you who are tracking aluminum, will know that the aluminum price is significantly, the LME and the Midwest premium is significantly higher than last year. In fact it's up by almost 70% from the - from the similar quarter in the previous year. So and then I’ll turn to what's happened in aluminum. So in the middle of October we ended up with the highest price we've ever seen for aluminum in the Midwest Premium and that's now fallen 15% from its high and now it’s like the end of October. So we don't know what's happening with aluminum. What we do know is that we have substantial quantities of cans; we have two new manufactures that have opened in the U.S. and are beginning to supply us. So that's a fact and we have also opened a number of additional co-packing facilities both in the U.S. and in Europe. So the cans are coming in, we have new co-packing capacity and what I'm hoping is that this inefficient freight that we've been experiencing, you know we spoke on previous calls about operating within orbits to minimize cost of distribution and cost of freight in. So now we've broken those orbits, because we haven't had capacity and we've been anxiously trying to service every case we can. So I'm hoping that in the fourth quarter and it's October really, that with these new co-packers opening up, that with the can capacity that we have, that we will start mitigating these inefficient freight costs that we are experiencing. But you know I can't talk about aluminum, because I don't know what's happening with aluminum and we were very careful not to buy forward on aluminum which, we normally do as our can companies, because we were nerv ous about what was going to happen. So that's where we are in the fourth quarte r. Certainly things are improving, but I cannot say that they are totally solved. And in Europe we've opened up also a number of new co-packers. We’re getting cans in Europe from India and from China, so even the European situation is being elevated. I would say if you compare it to the third quarter, I suspect we will have less issues in the fourth quarter than we have had in the third quarter, if that answers your question.

It’s been a big year in terms of innovation and investing behind supply. Brian, would love to get a little bit more color on what you see as the key learnings from rolling some of those investments out into the marketplace. And how they can inform the way investors should be thinking about supply growth and innovation in the years ahead. ."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mario Lu . . I have a couple on the long-term stays of 28 days and more. You guys mentioned that it was roughly 20% within 3Q. But I think in the first quarter, it was around 24%. Was this mostly due to seasonality that declined slightly since then. And then at a higher level, any updated views on how large the channel these larger stays could attract over time? ."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Chesky And I’ll just share a few more thoughts, Mario. We’ve just seen a major paradigm shift in travel. Before the pandemic, short-term stays is really the primary business that we were in. What we actually saw was that long-term stays was our fastest-growing segment of business even before the pandemic. So, I think what the pandemic did is an accelerated inevitable trend. There was already this emerging category between classic traveling and really kind of permanent housing which was people seeking stays of weeks at a time or even months at a time. And I think what the pandemic has done has just accelerated this. We’re going to see a lot more people going away as they have newfound flexibility. Even people with families who can’t go away during the year, they may be able to travel a little bit longer during summer as well. So this is really exciting. And the only other thing I’d just add is nearly half of our business is for more than a week as well. So these are really exciting categories. I think there’s a huge amount of growth going forward for these different segments."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jen Shi . This is Jen on for Justin. Just wondering, so you guys mentioned that with the host initiatives, you’re gaining supply in very popular areas like North America and Europe. Just wondering, are you seeing supply opening up in urban areas? And as the mix shift kind of comes back to urban and cross-border travel, how should we think about the impact on ADRs, take rate and maybe margins in future years? And then just one follow-up on marketing spend. Looking at marketing spend trends, obviously, this year has been super positive compared to pre-pandemic spending, you have a lot of leverage there. Just wondering, do you see a scenario where maybe you would have to be more aggressive on marketing if hotel travel was coming back? ."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Chesky And I can just share just to really recap briefly our marketing strategy. We take a really different approach than our competitors at the full funnel integrated marketing strategy. And it really starts with PR and word of mouth. And really word of mouth and PR’s how we build the brand for the vast majority of the years before you even have enough money to have a marketing budget. And because of that, Airbnb is a really well-known brand that’s a noun and a verb used all over the world. And because of this, more than 90% of our traffic was free or unpaid in Q3. And so we think of marketing is really education. Brand marketing is really about educating people that are highly differentiated product. And then performance marketing for us isn’t really a way to buy customers. It’s the way the laser in on balancing supply and demand. So we think this is a really unique approach. And I think that it’s just really all about continually investing in our brand. And over time, we think the amount of the loyalty to the brand will only increase."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin Kopelman  a lot. It’s Kevin from Cowen. Can you give us a sense of the booking trends in the fourth quarter, quarter-to-date. You mentioned acceleration in the shareholder letter, are you seeing that back to Q2 levels yet in terms of growth as compared to the same quarter in 2019, just given kind of the Delta slowdown, that would be helpful."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Stephenson Sure. what we’re seeing is continued strength in growing strength in the business as borders are starting to open up, people are more vaccinate more willing to kind of travel. We’re continuing to see bookings strength, and that’s why we’re going to be seeing gross booking rate of gross booking value growth increasing from Q3 to Q4. I don’t have a specific percentage that we’re sharing on the call today. There can be some variability on the overall growth, but it is accelerating. And that’s what’s included in our guidance estimate that we’ve shared."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Ju Okay. Brian, I don’t know if you have data – this data, but I’ll go ahead and ask anyway. But are you able to say perhaps what percentage of your registered users perhaps have younger children who until now were not able to get vaccinated. I’m just trying to get a sense for how much incremental pent-up demand you may have waiting for U.S. parents start to feel better about traveling more with the younger kids? ."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Stephenson No, I think that’s the key. Our cross-border travel, it’s 33% here in Q3, but we’re continuing to see strengthening here in October. More continued countries are reducing their travel restrictions and the travel trends continue to improve."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Brent Thill . Just on the cross-border, and when you think of Europe and what you’re seeing there, can you drill in and give us a sense of what’s starting to happen inside the country there."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Stephenson Sure. We’re continuing to see sequential improvement in the net nights booked in October relative to September. So travel restrictions as they come off. We’re continuing to see that sequential increase – We have more global net nights booked in October 21 that we did in 2019. So, I think that’s a really positive sign for Europe. And there are some week-to-week variations, but the trends continue to be up and to the right."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Brent Thill And as just a follow on, has there been anything surprising to you due to this recovery in Europe that just anything that you’ve seen in underlying trends? Or is it just continued strengthening as you’ve been mentioning?"
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Stephenson Well, the reality it tends to vary by country, right? Different countries will have different levels of restrictions in opening. There’s obviously a lot of pent-up demand for kind of peak kind of travel. We saw that in Q3 is a big part of the strength of our results in Q3 or Europeans wanting to get into their traditional kind of summer holidays in Spain and Italy and other places. And so there can be some variation by country throughout, but the strengthening of the business in Europe just kind of continues. We’re seeing a nice uptick in bookings, especially even leading into 2022. So some of the bookings growth that we’re seeing now is going to obviously be for travel in early next year and throughout in 2022."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dae Lee This is Dae Lee on for Doug. . The first one, so based on your conversation with your host, what do you think is the biggest friction point that prevented them from becoming a host for the first time? And along that line, among the initiatives that you’ve rollout for them this year was resonated in those? And as a follow-up, how are these newer host cohorts performing versus your historical cohorts but didn’t have the upgrade that now hosts have today."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Stephenson Sure. What we’re seeing – I can step back some of the new host acquisition that it makes it a little too early to tell exactly how the retention and things are going to work for all the new hosts. But let me step back and broadly share that overall, we’re seeing churn rate of our hosts or has improved. It’s lower than it had been historically that the actual success rate of new hosts is increasing. Like 50% of new listings receiving a booking in three days. 75% of new listings are receiving a booking within eight days. So they’re actually more successful, more quickly. We’re seeing of the new hosts that are coming on, that they are – the traditional host that have been successful in Airbnb, individual host that are largely – have exclusive to Airbnb that may only have a property or two, it’s that core individual host. That’s still the majority of the host that we’re kind of bringing on. And the cross listing of our host is actually down from where it was in kind of pre-COVID times. So I think the overall health of our hosting community is quite strong, and the growth that we’re seeing in new host is very consistent with the historic types of host we’ve had in the past."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Justin Patterson . . Brian, you’ve clearly had a lot of success with flexible stays. What have your learnings been around that, the marketing of that feature to consumers? And what do you think the next steps are to make this a broader consumer behavior? Is that more brand marketing? Or is that something within the app? That’s question one. And then for Dave’s question, two, how should I think about the pace of the urban recovery going forward? ."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jed Kelly .  for taking my question. We’ve seen a couple of larger call them, property managers and urban accommodation providers start to scale up inventory that will probably use your platform for bookings. So Brian, can you just provide us an update on how you’re working with some of the larger property managers. And then in your opening remarks, you did call out some major companies on the work from anywhere trends. Is there any way for you to work closer to them and provide benefits to the workers?"
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Chesky Yes.  for the question, Jed. Yes, let me take both of these large property managers and work from anywhere trends and how opportunities to work with companies. So on the first one, though our platform is 90% of individuals, the 10% of our hosts or professionals are very important to Airbnb, and we continue to build new tools for them. And so this just past year alone, we’ve had 150 upgrades and innovations and around half of those happened for a host. And many of the upgrades we have also applied to the more professional host as well. And so we’re going to be showing off a number of features on November 9, and many of these are going to be innovations for professional hosts in addition to individual hosts. So we’re still very focused in this area, and I continue to believe that we’re going to be growing really quickly. And just to give you an example, as Dave said, we’ve seen our fastest-growing areas of inventory in North America and Europe in nonurban areas. And certainly, professional hosts are a part of this. And I think they really love the amount of demand that we provide for them. Now as far as the work from anywhere approach. Yes, I think this is a really exciting area. I mean, as we said, Amazon, Ford, PwC, Procter & Gamble are just the beginning of the number of companies that have offered a more remote policy. I think it’s safe to say that very few companies that have office workers are going to be asking those workers to come back to an office five days a week. And all you have to believe as that people don’t come back five days a week, maybe they come back four days a week, maybe they come back three days a week, maybe they had even more flexible policies. And all we have to do is believe that, to believe that Zoom is here to stay, to believe that work from anywhere is here to stay. And so we’re starting to see a lot of companies certainly reach out to us. We don’t have anything to announce right now, but we are going to continually make it easier for people to be able to live anywhere and work anywhere on Airbnb and integrating with companies if that’s what it takes of course, would be something that we continue to do more of."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Unidentified Analyst This is Reese on for Colin. I was just wondering if you could talk about kind of the trends you’re seeing between the growth in nights booked versus adoption of experiences? And is there any difference in the trajectory of recovery there? And then maybe just how your relationships with communities  are doing? .
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Chesky Yes. I can take these. So obviously, the growth of our core business of homes has been very, very strong. With experiences, I really expected last year to be a breakout year for Airbnb experiences. And of course, the opposite happened. The pandemic put that product on pause. That being said, it’s now been more than 1.5 years, and I feel like people can only stay home so many nights watching Netflix. And eventually, they want to get out of house. And I do think people want alternative things like restaurants, especially when they’re traveling. And Airbnb experiences are very popular amongst our guests. They actually love even more than homes statistically from a five star standpoint. In other words, more guests leave a five star review for experiences in the homes after they stay. So I’m very bullish on this product. It’s been gradually ramping back up and reopening. We’ve seen strong growth over the last couple of quarters, and I’m expecting this to be a big area of growth over the coming five years or so. So that’s what we’re seeing with experiences. Now with regards to our relationship with communities, let me just start by saying this. Even before the pandemic, we worked with thousands of cities all over the world. You see we created this new category of travel, and we had to work with cities to educate them and work collaboratively with them to be able to really make sure everybody works best for these communities. To give you a stat, we have today, collected $4 billion in hotel occupancy tax or transient occupancy tax. You can’t collect hotel tax without working with those cities and jurisdictions. So we’ve had really close relationships with them. And what I’ve seen in the last year is that the pandemic has actually been a bit of a  reset for our relationship with cities. And reset probably in a good way because what we’re seeing is a lot of cities that we’re concerned with tourism in their markets are in a different concern now. Now over tourism the number of cities have to under tourism. The reduction of business travel, fewer international travelers crossing borders going into big cities means that many of these cities and destinations have revenue shortfalls and just general travel shortfalls. And so what’s happened is we’ve had a lot of cities reaching out to us to collaborate. And in fact, we’ve done 100 partnerships with destination marketing organizations, around the world. And I think our new and flexible features where we can point demand to where we have supply also means we can point demand to cities that want it. And so I think this is a really exciting period for us to, really renew a  relationship with cities all over the world."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Brian Fitzgerald  guys. On the cross-border travel, I open up, we’re just wondering if you could comment on lengths of stay trends there. Our intuition is that people are going to get on a plane in the current environment, they probably want to amortize that across a longer stay. But just wondering what you’re seeing there. And then second thing on about the length of stay more generally. You spoke to 28-days plus, and just wondering if you could talk to what you’re seeing in terms of maybe a seven day stay becoming a 14-day and any trends there? And any thoughts on how the competitiveness of Airbnb increases versus hotels as one week stays, become two week stays."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Stephenson Yes. We highlighted on the shareholder letter that 45% of our nights were from stays at least seven nights. And this is the trend that we’re seeing is that the length of stay continues to increase. The number of use cases that people find working with Airbnb in the same way that Brian just mentioned, it’s just a better way to travel for longer. You’re not going to want to stay in a hotel room for 28 nights, but those trends are continuing. And I don’t have anything specific to say about cross-border and the length of stay directly related to that. But just more broadly that the length of stay continues to increase. And to the extent that it does, it accretes to Airbnb."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Chesky Yes. I can take both of those, Naved. Number one, just in Apple, their iOS changes. No, we’ve not seen any impact on Airbnb, and that’s not really the business we’re in. With regards to our efforts to invest in technology to onboard hotels. Let’s just talk a little bit about our strategy with hotels. Last year, we had to make some difficult decisions to put a number of initiatives on pause, like transportation and scale back some others. And one of the initiatives that we had to scale back a bit was our investment in hotels. That being said, hotels are still a very important part of Airbnb’s strategy. We believe that people come to Airbnb because we have something unique. We have unique host to offer something you can’t get anywhere else. And so we think that the majority of people come to Airbnb direct to book individual host. That being said, we want to make sure that people come to Airbnb, they always find a place to stay. And sometimes we have network gaps. And we think that hotels are really  ways to fill a network gap. So when somebody comes to Airbnb, they can always find a place to stay. HotelTonight has been growing really steadily in the last couple of years. I’m very excited about the progress, and we’re continually investing in this area. Now it’s not as big a priority as our core business of supporting individual hosts, but we’re continually supporting them. We’re continually investing in this area."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Naved Khan Maybe just to follow up on that, Brian, would we be seeing hotels on the core Airbnb time in the future or anytime soon?"
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Naved Khan Would we see hotels on core Airbnb at all?
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Chesky Yes. I mean, yes. And we have tens of thousands of other terms now on Airbnb, and I expect you to see more in the future for sure. And it’s just – it’s really just a matter of prioritization. Right now, we are focused on the most perishable opportunities the most perishable opportunities right now are scaling as quickly as possible to get as many hosts ready to host as many guests as possible. And so our big priorities are recruiting hosts, simplifying the guest experience, educating the world that would make certain be different, that’s hosting, and getting world-class service to getting our service to be at a world-class level. Those are our major priorities, but we are continually investing in hotels."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Zach Morrissey . This is Zach on from Deepak. Just first on ADRs, I know you kind of called out that the primary driver so far has been this kind of mix shift. But you also noted that you’re starting to see some price appreciation in certain high-demand areas. Just curious if you can kind of parse this out a little further. And is that trend kind of concerning to you in the context of Airbnb’s long-term growth? And then second, just related to COVID, I know it’s very dynamic and hard to predict. But the restrictions seem to be generally easing, but we are seeing pockets of rising cases and some kind of impediments to travel demand. Do you see any kind of differences in the restrictions today and the impediment to demand behavior today versus six or 12 months ago? ."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dave Stephenson Sure. Let me start with the ADR. The trend that we saw in ADR late last year, the increase in ADR was almost exclusively driven by mix. And so that was the regional mix urban, nonurban mix, size of home. And then what we saw earlier in the year is some price appreciation as a larger portion of the ADR increase. And that increased a little bit further here in Q3, kind of the peak kind of summer travel season. And then what we’re seeing, as I said in Q4, is our ADRs are relatively stable with what they were in Q3. Even with these elevated ADRs, again, the majority of the increase has been just on a relative basis due to mix. So there’s really no change in the price where there is some price appreciation. I think we still have a  value. We’re still able to give people, homes and stays that they find very valuable in terms of all the amenities they get. Maybe a larger place, more amenities, kitchen, more bedrooms, there’s more space to be. And so we think we continue to give a  value. And so we’ll continue to monitor it and be mindful of it. But I don’t think it’s an existential threat to us. And then the second question is just rising cases, any differences versus the pandemic. I guess I think what we’ve seen is just a bit more resilience in guests being willing to travel around the world, right? There’s a little bit of – there could be pockets of variation depending on what governments frankly do in terms of opening up borders. And – but the general trend has continued to be more positive, more up into the right and more consistent. And I think people, even in the face of various strains of COVID continue to be wanting to travel, and they find that doing that on Airbnb is the best way to do it."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Mahaney  a lot. This is Ben on for Mark. So in the last 18 months, COVID has allowed Airbnb to really pivot their product priorities to refocus on the core business. As you look to next year, do you anticipate your investment priorities to change somewhat? Are you going to start focusing on stuff a little bit outside of your core business? And then the second question, if I could. Just in the letter you talked about in relation to APAC, just the short-term rental restrictions as being somewhat of a drag on the recovery in that region. Are those new restrictions versus 2019? And how significant are they? Do you expect them to be a permanent drag? ."
4465796,Airbnb's,ABNB,11/5/2021,CEO Brian Chesky on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Brian Chesky And then on your question of new investments. Here’s what I would say. I mean, we learned some very valuable lessons last year about focus. I remember once I was in college and my teachers told me, Brian, you can do everything you want in your life just not all at the same time. Yes, we certainly learned that less than last year. We had to scale back initiatives. But one of the benefits of all that, we took our very best people and we focused them only on a few problems, including recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest journey, improving a world-class service and educating the world about Airbnb. And as we’ve done that, we’ve not only reduced costs in the business, but we’ve actually been growing even faster. And so this year has been a year of a relentless innovation to perfect our core service nearly one innovation every 48 hours on our core service. That being said, we are going to do new things Airbnb. We created this category of travel. And I think there’s a lot more categories that we can create in Airbnb. And so we’ve done two releases this year. We did one in May and one in November, and we’re going to do a couple more again next year. And so November will not be the last time you hear from us. You’ll hear from us again in the spring, where we’ll introduce a summer release for the summer, and we’re going to have some really big new offerings as well. And again, the really big areas I’m excited about that we’re currently doing, short-term stays. I think we’re realizing that we are just scratching the surface of this incredibly huge opportunity as home sharing continues to grow. Long-term stays is an entirely new category for Airbnb. And I think now that people are getting comfortable crossing borders, can get outside and getting gathering with other people, experience will be a big opportunity. But this is just the beginning. We have many more innovations in front of us, and we will continue to use our creativity to design new possibilities for people."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Brian Nowak  for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Dara curious just to hear about what you learned about pricing elasticity on rideshare sort of throughout the pandemic and the recovery and pricing and how should we think about the rides' incremental margin potential as we sort of go forward and you sort of balance profitability with those five key areas of investment? Then the second one, sounds like there's an update to Uber Pass coming, did any numbers at all, you can help us sort of understand where you are now within size, what type of uptick do you see in volume or frequency or stickiness as any stats on Uber Pass right now? ."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dara Khosrowshahi And I think as far as Uber Pass goes, I don't want to take the thunder away from the team who's done a bunch of work. You know, membership now we got over 6 million members globally, it accounts for more than 20% of our gross bookings, we think all of those numbers can increase pretty significantly. We continue to see really good engagement from members on the Eats side Eats members, their trips per month increased by over 50%. Members versus non-members, even basket sizes are higher, basket sizes are up versus non-members, in average of 10%. When you look at kind of the potential of membership, because we are launching in and a ton of markets all over, I would point to one market, Taiwan, where members account for er than 50% of gross bookings. So we absolutely believe we can get there. And members now in Taiwan are eating with us 15 times per month, which is 3x non-members. So that's the kind of engagement that you can start getting with a service that becomes an everyday part of your use case. And I think we're just scratching the surface here. We're very, very early in our development here. And remember, that we have the best membership content so to speak, than anyone has, because our membership will offer not only food, not only grocery and alcohol, but is also going to offer Mobility as well. It's a structural advantage that others just don't have access to and I think one that we're going to press."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Eric Sheridan  so much for taking the question. Maybe following up on the point you made answering Brian's question. Can we just get a better sense of what you're seeing early days in terms of the opportunity set versus the addressable market in non-Food Delivery in the US and how we should be thinking about the sizing and cadence of those investments going forward when you measure them against the opportunity?  so much.
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ross Sandler Only two questions here. Hey, guys. The Halloween comment's pretty interesting. That's historically one of the biggest, if not the biggest Friday update of the year or weekend. So, I guess, where do you stand on the rides MAPCs versus 2019? And is it just the frequency lower for some of these work and commute day parts? Could you talk about how far off those day parts or those trips are those categories from 2019 peak levels? And then the second question is, if we step back and kind of look at the original bull case for ride hailing, it was that you know, prices would come down to low enough level where consumers start to shift trips over to ride hail and away from public transportation or car ownership. And right now these price is pretty hard to see not playing out. So how do we get back to that? And if we do see much lower prices a few years out, you know, how confident are you that you can maintain the strong level of unit economics you're seeing right now?  a lot."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Nelson Chai The only thing I want to add is, because you did ask about the times a day. So, on a global basis I think you heard in our comments that we're about 85% recovered in October. And so, we're during workday, which define it as you know, as you can figure out we're over 95% recovered. On commute, we're over 90% recovered but we really haven't seen a comeback still is, you know airports continue to lag at about you know 67% recovered. So we are seeing the recovery. But there are certain times a day and what we call party and fun times as well is under 80% recovered as well."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael McGovern Hey,  for taking our question. This is Mike on for Justin. We want to ask about the category share trends that you're seeing in Delivery, especially in the US, maybe in October and your willingness to potentially invest in gaining category share. And then quick second question, we want to ask about the advertising business and the impact that that's had on the Delivery take rate. I think you called out 400 basis point benefit in certain Delivery markets for the take rates. I was wondering does that include advertising or could you dig into that metric a little bit? ."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Mahaney Okay, . Two things. One, comment on the synergies between the two business Delivery and Mobility both on the Driver side and on the consumer side, any update there? And then just on the driver incentives, I think that peak quarter was Q2 just talk about where and maybe you mentioned this earlier, but just an update on where those driver incentives, what happened to them Q2 to Q3? And is the outlook that you're at a point now where those will steadily continue to decline under most market circumstances?  a lot."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dara Khosrowshahi Yeah, Mark in terms of synergy, it's obviously we have user side synergy and call it, earner side synergy. And the synergy, it continues to improve. It's not a one-time thing like we're constantly optimizing. So about 50% of, for example, US and UK, gross bookings come from cross platform users, that number is closer to 45% globally and generally increasing. In the US now, Mobility continues to be a very significant customer acquisition tool for Eats. So now a quarter of US first-time eaters are coming from our rides business, which is pretty extraordinary. For prospective, that's more new users than we get from Google, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, from all of these paid entities combined. So it's free. We have tested that because it's, you know, consumers actually like this super app that we're building. And the numbers are significant and increasing. And then on the other side, what's interesting is that, 20% of US Mobility first trips are coming from eaters. So now that we have a very, very big delivery business, we're able to now cross platform into whether it's off for us or on the app or off the app, we're able to promote into our Mobility business. That number for the UK, for example, is 40%. I'll repeat it, 40% of UK first trip Mobility users actually came from Eats were Eats users, which is pretty extraordinary. So we just have this cross kind of pollenization of users that's pretty extraordinary. And listen, in any one year, it's not going to make a giant different in the business. But it's a compounding of this advantage of essentially free traffic for both our Mobility and Delivery business, that over a period of you know, five to seven years, becomes very, very significant. And it can either show up in margin or it can show up on share, or it can show up in the size of the business. On the driver side, one thing that's pretty cool is that, about a third of our new driver signups now are driving both people and food, so to speak. And that is a higher number than our overall number. So about 25% of our drivers in the US drive both people and food. That number was in the teens pre-pandemic. So it's going up from the teens to 25% overall, and new drivers, a third of them are electing to do both. So that again is like the iteration of a product getting better and better in terms of kind of pushing both services or offering both services, both on the demand and supply side. So we're not done. I think you will see improved results compounding on top and improved results which is definitely going to differentiate us over a period of time."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Byun Hi, ,  very much. This is John Byun for Brent Thill. I had two questions. One is could maybe give an update on the operational integration of you know Drizly, Postmates, Cornershop. You know, just in general, the acquisitions and partnerships in the geographic availability, how far along  you're on? And the second on the Delivery bookings were flat to down a little bit quarter-on-quarter, you know, there was some commentary in the release, but is there anything else you could share to why they might be the seasonal, is it quarterly reopening? ."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Yruma Hey, guys, . You indicated, I guess some contexts behind the headwinds due to the fee caps and the UK worker roles. I'm just trying to say in the medium-term, do you need to seek regulatory relief to improve those? Or do you think that there are pricing mechanisms or other ways for you to alleviate some of the pressure you know from some of these gains? ."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dara Khosrowshahi So I think on the regulatory front, listen, there's we're certainly not counting as it relates to our go-forward numbers in Q4 or next year, the regulatory environment changing it's, you know, we're kind of predicting the environment that we operate in. We think that from a regulatory standpoint, you know, fee caps are poor regulation. And essentially, they force us to increase costs to eaters, and they don't make sense from a regulatory standpoint that they're, you know, we think illegal, and we will challenge them appropriately. But I do think that as far as our plans go, we're not counting on regulatory relief there."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Deepak Mathivanan . . So the first one, I think you noted that EMEA and LatAm, have almost fully recovered on Mobility business in October. Can you give some color on the marketplace dynamics in these regions between pricing and volumes? Also I mean, clearly, not all the use cases in these regions have probably fully recovered, but wondering where you see the incremental usage up in these regions? And then second question, can you give some additional color on what we should expect on EBITDA trends between the two businesses separately like rides share need for 4Q, I know there are some seasonality in 4Q rice take rates. But how should we think about EBITDA? ."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Balaji Krishnamurthy Operator, we can take the final question. Your final question comes from John Blackledge from Cowen. Your line is open."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Blackledge , . Two questions. First, just given the improvements in driver supply in the quarter, when do you think Uber will be at kind of appropriate driver supply to meet the rising Mobility demand? And what the driver utilization gains that you kind of discussed earlier, Dara? As things returned to normal, would you expect to hold on to those driver, those high driver utilization levels? And then just a quick one on the new delivery verticals as a percentage of Delivery GBs in 3Q? And how should that mix trend over time? ."
4465803,"Uber Technologies, Inc.",UBER,11/5/2021,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dara Khosrowshahi Yeah, sure. I think listen on the driver supply side, I don't think we're ever going to have enough drivers. I think we're going to want to keep growing our driver supply base, you know, remember in Q4, my saying that you know, are growing our driver supply base and building our relationship with drivers who use the platform and making this a truly, truly  platform to earn on, flexibly earn on is, it's a strategic imperative for the company. And as we grow the use cases, you know, the Mobility use cases, with the new product that I talked about with the Pool product and the high capacity vehicle products and the enterprise high capacity vehicle products in two wheelers and three wheelers, we just think we're going to attract a broader segment of earners, onto the platform along with Delivery. And we are now learning more and through experimentation and data, understanding what the situations are where we can encourage drivers to deliver food and what are the occasions where we can have couriers move people around as well. So I think we're going to see more earners on our platform for years and years to come. And we are finally getting the right muscle in terms of promoting cross platform usage, which is going to lead to higher yield realization on our platform in terms of time of day, and in terms of, you know, driver utilization, structurally, you know, there'll be an advantage over the other players. So we want to be that platform that is kind of the one-stop shop for earners that they keep coming back to for a long period of time. As far as New Verticals as a percentage of Delivery bookings, it's in the 6% to 7% range at this point. And obviously, we want to break into double-digits next year and the years beyond. We are very, very early in the growth curve. We are in investment mode. But I'd say, we're imprudent investment mode. And again, we have the advantage of having audience and it's about cross promoting to our audience, we got a right from Rides to Eats. We're getting it right from Eats the Rides. And we're going to get it right in terms of Eats to New Verticals."

I wanted to follow-up on Gary's question earlier. You were gracious enough to give us a September breakdown. But may I trouble you to ask about how you think mobile versus broadband will perform in the December quarter? And then I've got a follow-up."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kris Sennesael We just guided for total company at $1.5 billion, which is up 14% sequentially. And we do see both mobile and broad markets growing at double-digit sequentially. Probably a little bit stronger in mobile than in broad markets, but both at the double-digit sequential growth."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Harsh Kumar There's a lot of talk about China trends right now. And there's a lot of mixed signals being given by the earnings that are coming out. I was hoping, Liam, you could talk about what kind of trends you're seeing in the Chinese market. If you're seeing any mix shift, up or down, either ways, that may be benefiting you or not benefiting you. Just curious what color you got in China."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Timothy Arcuri Kris, now that the fiscal year is over, can you give us a sense of what your top customer was for fiscal 2021?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kris Sennesael The top customer came in at 59% of total revenue on a full-year basis. By the way, in Q4, that was approximately the same 59%, which is slightly up from the Q4 of fiscal 2020, which was at 56%. But of course, you have to take into account the timing of the launch of some of the new smartphone platforms there. This is a big number, but it really underscores the deep customer engagement that we have with this customer. By the way, not only in the smartphone lineup, but almost in every other product that they have and that they sell, you will find Skyworks inside. Also, in Q4, the quarter we just closed, the Skyworks team really executed well, supporting the launch and the ramp of new smartphone platform that yet again for now almost 10 or 13 times in a row, we were able to obtain higher dollar content per phone, as witnessed by the teardowns that came out when the form came out. And you can see, when you look at the teardowns, we really provided multiple high performance, very complex, highly integrated solutions, multiple sockets in that phone. That includes, in many cases, multiple best-in-class filters, including TC-SAW and Bulk Acoustic Wave technology across the transmit chain, the receive chain, as well as many other functionalities, including GPS and Wi-Fi, of course. So  execution there by the team."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Timothy Arcuri I guess as my follow-up, there's kind of a lot of noise in the China market. I know that you don't have as much exposure to the domestic market or at least Chinese OEMs as some of your peers do. But there are some diverging data points. End market sell-through is not . But, definitely, the high tier seems pretty tight. So, can you just talk about what you're seeing in China? Maybe you can have a distinction between sell-in and sell-through?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ambrish Srivastava Liam, we heard conflicting commentary yesterday from two of your peers. Just wanted your perspective on constraints. And it clearly seems like it's not impacted your business. But how has that trended? And more importantly, given the very well publicized shortfall in one of your large customers, what does that mean for the March quarter seasonality. And then I had a follow-up for you, Kris."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Liam Griffin We'll try to unpack that one at a time. With respect to our ability to execute and deliver, in cases maybe where some others were not able to do that, is really about investments that we've made and investments that we made early. So, if you let me indulge here for a minute, go back to where we were a year ago, we went from $3.3 billion to $5.1 billion in one year. In one year. With no M&A. How do we do that? Well, we made those investments months and months, 6 to 12 months before to ready ourselves to win. And also, knowing that we had the right customer set that appreciated the performance and technology that we could bring to the market. And so, that worked  for us and we executed tremendously. The upside of that is those capital assets and those technology investments are there, they're on the job today. But there's a lot more we need to do. So, of course, we were nicked up a little bit here in the supply chain issues and shortages. But having our assets in-house, and you've heard me talk about this for a long time, having those assets in-house are strategic, it's critical, it's what customers want to see, all the way from gallium arsenide to packaging, assembly and test, TC-SAW, Bulk Acoustic Wave, standard SAW, all of that. We can mix and match to put the right solution together. So, t hat is one of the reasons why our numbers here that we're talking about today. They're very strong. Certainly, we're experiencing the same market environment. But it was the ability to invest early, drive that cash flow, drive that performance to continue to do that and then bring those products to market in ways tha t are very flexible and having the ability to go from IoT to 5G to Bluetooth to Wi-Fi. Whatever the connectivity protocol may be, we will have the technology execution vehicles within our company to execute for our customers."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Liam Griffin We're not going to get into March at this point. March tends to be a little bit of a soft spot in the year. That's been traditional, but we don't really have a guide here to March at this point."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ambrish Srivastava Kris, I had a quick one and a longer one. Sorry. The quick one is capital and CapEx for the fiscal year. And really just looking at your cap intensity, I think it ties back to what Liam just said. It's much higher than at least your closest peer. Should we expect it to stay in the high single-digit, double-digit. And then longer term, you now have a business that has a much bigger footprint of higher margin broad, diversified business segments. Isn't it time to revisit the long-term margin target and why should it not trend up versus what you've given us in the past? ."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Caso My question is on the magnitude of the content gains this year. And based on your guidance, it looks like second half mobile revenues up about 9% year-on-year. And looking at the second half to normalize for the different product launches. But I guess the question is, out of that 9%, is that all attributable to content? Is there any kind of unit growth in there? Is there any unit decline baked in those numbers? Recognize that we're coming off some pretty exceptional content gains last year, but trying to gauge what they look like this year?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Liam Griffin Chris, we certainly see the opportunity to, again, push forth er content, er value, and it comes with technology, right? So, I think our teams are constantly crafting and developing next generation solutions. And also broadening the reach. So it isn't just a certain set of customers. It's a broader set of customers. What we find is that there's just a tremendous need for performance, right? Performance is really what's going to drive this. And then, performance really means that you've got to deliver the technology behind that. So, we're spending a lot of money in that area. But strategically, we've got some  R&D folks inhouse that are crafty, that know how to get stuff done. And developing solutions for the next wave, right? Markets like Wi-Fi 6 and 6E are also right now in a  position for growth as we move forward. And I think connectivity around Wi-Fi is going to be  and will complement what we're doing in classic mobile device. So, I think there's a lot of good stuff going on. The appetite with our customers is fantastic. There's no end to the ideas and the inquiries and the challenges that we're being asked to address, which is . I'd much rather talk about that than worry about supply chains. And I think on the supply chain side, we're doing quite well. But we really want to continue to raise our bar with our technology and our R&D teams and our execution to bring customers the performance levels that they really need."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Caso I was going to ask you a follow-up question on supply chain then. So, something you don't want to talk about. But with regard to some of the supply constraints, we've heard from many others in the industry that you weren't able to – many haven't been able to ship everything that the customers wanted here in the second half of the year. Is that still happening with you folks? Are you still constrained to the fact that you can't ship everything the customers asked for? And does that suggest that there's going to be some catch up in terms of your shipments as you go into the seasonally slower first half of the calendar year?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Snyder Kris, one of the standout parts that you landed your largest customer is the transmit diversity module, which is a very rich part, uses BAW filters, as well, as I'm sure, TC-SAW. You've not had that before. I know it's one part among many. But given the content of that part, I would expect the margins on that are going to be better than at least the average, if not the highest among that. Given the customer, the unit volumes should be pretty high. Should we expect if we see more of those, not just at that customer, but at others as Samsung and those folks move to more of the sophisticated 5G features? That would be a significant margin driver for you, given the size of mobile and the size of these customers?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Kris Sennesael I assume you can understand I can't discuss specific gross margin on specific parts for specific customers.
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Snyder But it was a trend. I'm looking for the trend because 5G, obviously, for the high end phones is now moving from basic connectivity to vastly more advanced connectivity. And part and parcel of that are going to be transmit DRx modules and this is the first one we see. So, as we see more of those in all phones, especially from you, shouldn't we expect margin to increase to?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kris Sennesael Absolutely. And I've talked about that before, right? The largest contribution to our overall gross margin improvement strategy is to bring higher complexity, higher value added, highly integrated parts that really enhances the performance of the product of our customer. And our customers understand that that requires a lot of R&D, that that requires CapEx dollars to be invested. And that requires a certain value to be paid for that. And that is how we have been driving the gross margin improvements for the last 20 years as we move from 2G to 3G to 4G, and now to 5G. And indeed, adding more value to our products. You're absolutely right about that."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Snyder If I could, you've kind of been under earning a little bit at Samsung. They were high single-digit percentage revenue probably last quarter. I know they're on the way up here. Did they broach 10% this quarter? And more importantly, by looking at the next couple of quarters, especially the beginning of next year, should we expect you to continue to gain ground here? Or will mix – because I know they're favoring more the low end products at this point, will mix kind of hold the lid on it for the short term and then we should look for out periods maybe late next year or so to see further gains?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kris Sennesael Absolutely. They were not a 10% customer, but you are right, they are up to the right. So, the trend is the business is growing sequentially, as well as year-over-year. As Liam pointed out before, we have  design win momentum with them, as you can see in some of the teardowns as well, with some very rich complex parts in their phone lineup. And by the way, not dissimilar to with the large customer, not only in their phone lineup, but many of their other devices that they sell that have wireless connectivity embedded as well."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Snyder If I could, maybe a final one. Liam, for you. It's no secret that Qualcomm is getting some share in the low-end China phones, low band. They've led in some of those. [indiscernible] mid, high band. There's a lot of chatter in the chain anyway that it's kind of a combination of things that performances [indiscernible] has improved certainly. But also, as we saw yesterday, the shortages in chips has given them even er leverage and kind of compelling some of the smaller OEMs or the low end of the bigger OEMs to use some of their RF products. How do you see that shaking out for your share in China short-term? And maybe you could comment on the long term trend with that. Do you think it will be sticky given the supply in the modem? Or once supply chain eases up, we'll get a reversion back to the mean?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Blayne Curtis I just want to follow-up on the broad markets. I guess I was a little bit confused. So, the business was up about $40 million. I think the acquisition add more than double that. So, I guess I didn't hear from you what's weak? Is it a supply issue? I think if I had it right, I think Wi-Fi might have been a little weak in June and I think you were looking for it to come back. So, second, what's weak? And then I guess you're forecasting it to rebound in December, what's driving that?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kris Sennesael Blayne, you're absolutely right. When Liam talked about some of the tightness in the supply chain, it's especially more so in the broad markets business. By the way, not only because Skyworks is not able to supply, but the issue of full bill of materials or keeping issues, right, some of our customers are struggling to get parts from peers and competitors or other players in the industry. And so, as a result of that, they don't necessarily need the Skyworks parts right now. They will need them later. So, that I think was driving most of that in broad markets. But again, looking ahead to December and then beyond, we do assume that some of the tightness in the supply gets resolved, that they will get to full bill of materials. And that, of course, also Skyworks can resolve some of the tightness in its own supply chain and that will further drive revenue growth in broad markets. Because if you look at it overall high level, there is very strong demand for connectivity in a broad set of products. If you look at automotive, industrial, some consumer type of applications, there is very strong demand, and we don't see that slowing down."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Blayne Curtis Can I ask a similar question on the mobile side? Given the Apple revenue that you reported, it's not perfect math, but it does seem like Android is down in September, maybe double digits. And I'm just kind of curious, if I had that math right, is it a similar issue with kitting or something else? And I guess for December, the whole mobile group should be up double digits, as you said, but I was just kind of curious if Android would be part of that, given it was down in September."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kris Sennesael No, that's how it has been for the last five years that I have been with the company, right? In September and December, when the large customer launches their new platforms, they have priority in the supply chain, not only with Skyworks, but with many of the peers and competitors. And so, Android understands that and they are not going to put up a fight for supply with the large North American customer. Especially this year when it's very tight, even more so than then in the last five years, you will see some seasonal fluctuations there. Absolutely. Our final question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from Cowen and Company."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Karl Ackerman I wanted to focus on your broad markets business, if I may. You now do have a more diversified products and end markets within broad markets through the integration of SLAB's auto industrial business. I was hoping you could describe whether the acquisition is performing in line with your initial expectations. And if you could peel back the onion and discuss some of the opportunities you are seeing for your timing, power isolation and Wi-Fi products."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Liam Griffin Let me add to that. There's a tremendous diversification lever here with the I&A business from SLAB. There's tremendous opportunity in the technologies. We have scale that is just incredible compared to the size that had been there before. So, we are working very closely on the strategic technologies within the I&A portfolio. We're seeing some ,  opportunities there. And we're going to bring a lot of that stuff inhouse, into our sites, into our factories and streamline. We're also going to do some strong cross pollenization of the sales team to make sure that we understand exactly where the opportunities are and the scale plays are. And I think there's a lot that can be done there. There's  technology there. We just need to bring it to the right customers and raise the game. The s upply chain issues kind of hit that portfolio a little bit harder than others. But it doesn't take us off our track. And the technologies that we acquired are outstanding, and we're going to cultivate and grow those technologies with customers, for sure."
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Karl Ackerman For my follow-up, if I may. I know this has been asked several times. I want to try and ask it a different way. You suggested that mobile will grow double digits next quarter. I'm curious if that reflects some moderation of mobile products within China? And I ask because it seems that some of the demand in China has pushed from December into March. And I'm curious if you would endorse that view. Simply put, is this a supply issue? Is this a demand issue? And how would you see that being rectified over the next few quarters?"
4465807,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc.",SWKS,11/5/2021,CEO Liam Griffin on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kris Sennesael When you look at the data, the demand for 5G phones in China continues to be very strong. There's no question about that. I'm not talking here about 4G, 3G or 2G phones. I'm talking about 5G phones. demand in China continues to be very strong. And there's multiple suppliers. Of course, the large North American customer supplies into China and is doing really well there. And then, of course, there's the Android players as well. Now, as I said before, there is seasonality to that business. And September and December are not the strongest seasonal quarters for that business because a lot of the supply goes to the large North American customer. But you typically see some somewhat of a rebound into the March quarter as well with Chinese New Year being part of that March quarter. And we expect that to play out this year as well. , ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.  all for participating on today's call. We look forward to talking to you with you at upcoming investor conferences. ."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tim Long . Maybe just one on the video and access control, obviously, 30% plus really strong this year, can you talk a little bit about sustainability as we look into next year? And what do you think some of the real guideposts we should be watching as far as drivers, NDAA, FCC, any other things that could lead to market share gains there? And then the follow-up on the command center software side, low double digits. I think, there have been some views, it could be better than that. So maybe can you talk a little bit about, what needs to be done for that business to reaccelerate from these levels? Is it winning new customers? Is it more stimulus? Is it more the bundle sales? If you could give us some color on that too. That'd be . ."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler And just in terms of specific things that we're doing a core tenet for us is always to meet customers where they are. That's a part of our product strategy. Many of our customers have invested in some sophisticated IT infrastructure on-premises, and they would like to continue to benefit from those investments, but they also know that certain cloud capabilities are just better. Those capabilities are just better delivered through the cloud, and we want to give the customers the flexibility to choose and to move to the cloud in their own timeline. And so with relation to that, we're offering flexibility in deployment via hybrid offerings, and we're doing three specific things there. One, we're offering our on-prem solutions, inclusive of CAD and Records on a subscription basis. We're going to be integrating the capabilities, both existing and new capabilities in command central cloud with our on-prem solutions to allow our customers to choose what capabilities they would like to consume from the cloud. And third, cybersecurity is a very important consideration, regardless of whether the solution is deployed on-prem or whether it's in the cloud or integrating cybersecurity monitoring as a service into both the solutions as a whole. I think all of that combined really accelerates the adoption of cloud capabilities across all our customers."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sami Badri . First around this time of every single year, you should give us out year initial takes or views. Greg, I was hoping you'd give us any kind of guideposts for revenue or EPS growth or even margin. And then the second question, I have is actually on just U.S. federal on what percentage of revenue that was in the quarter? And what the expectation is for U.S. federal revenues to be for the full year. That's it. ."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler And Sami, to mention the second part of your question with respect to Fed, it's roughly 8% of our revenues. Well, we're having another strong year in Fed like last year. So 8% of revenues is, is its contribution to us. It's one in totality. It's one of our largest customers."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sami Badri Perfect. And actually I had one follow-up and maybe this is for Mahesh. It's about the M500 in-car video system enabled by AI. Do you guys have any competitors that actually do this right now, at least with an install-based like yours and even a rollout or even go-to-market product like yours?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler As we look at next year and plan for it, the linearity we're looking at for Q1 is more consistent with 2019, about 21%. In fact, the 2019 first half, or the entirety of the linearity of that year looks to be a better indicator for what we see in terms of supply chain and the planning we're doing for the business."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kyle McNealy Hi guys.  very much for the question. I'm on here for George Notter. This was a really strong result for a product backlog coming out of the quarter. It looks like you've had a good quarter for the number of larger LMR deals and that seems to be driving. And you had a good portion from U.S. and international. So I'm wondering if you can comment on what's driving the volume of larger deals, like, is there something specific or a trend that's kind of going on in the near term? Or is this general continued macro recovery after the pandemic eases worldwide? And I'm also wondering if you could expect that momentum to continue based on your view of the pipeline. ."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Brown Yes. And Kyle, just the last thing I'd say is, as I said, in my prepared remarks, demand is strong and our demand visibility is good. In addition to the backlog that Jack articulated and the linearity that Jason just said, taking a step back, this is more than just pent-up demand. It's a reflection of what we do is a need to have versus a nice to have the funding environment, a s I referenced both budgets and stimulus is strong. We've refreshed a lot of the portfolio on the product side. We've made a conscious investment in go-to-market channels and feet on The Street we've continued to acquire. We've got the benefit of the National Defense Authorization Act. More revenue is software and services oriented. So I think there's a lot of different positive ingredients in the blender here that continue to fuel our growth going forward."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kyle McNealy Okay, .  very much. And one follow-up, do you – I'm not sure if you mentioned it, but do you have an update on the run rate of the PCR business now and maybe an outlook for the continued recovery and the outlook for PCR?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Brown Yes, I think PCR is where the supply chain challenges most acute. It grew in Q3. It will grow for the full year, Kyle probably as we match supply and demand and it's fluid, it will, we expect it to end up about mid to high-single-digit growth with a reasonable chunk of delinquent backlog for us to execute against in 2022."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Adam Tindle Okay. . . I wanted to start on the product and system integration margin expansion. Operating profit grew at double the rate of revenue basically, and had nice margin expansion in that segment. I wouldn't consider this an industry where you'd get short-term pricing power benefit to hit margins positively, so just maybe looking for some more color on the PSI margin expansion? And then as an extension to that question, I look at that segment, before COVID, it was a low to mid-20s operating margin, clearly not going to finish there in 2021 based on your guidance, but maybe some of the gating factors to getting back to those historical operating margins in that segment would be helpful."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler Sure. So . So one thing that's we're pleased with the operating margin expansion in products. One thing that we are benefiting from is the prioritization of our portfolio to public safety. So that's a favorable mix element around margins and ASP's. As Greg mentioned and Jack we're constrained more so in PCR, which is a bit on the lower tier. So favorable mix is definitely improving what you see in Q3, we're pleased with the OE performance on the year. I would also remind you that as we began the year and plan this year at the OE line for the company, we were facing $100 million dollar year-over-year increase in incentives, as we reset the plans to 100% coming off of last year where we only paid half. So the bulk of that $100 million for the year is in the product segment. So we're expanding, operating margins despite overcoming that additional P&L burden. In terms of its outlook, we're continuing to manage through higher input costs, higher freight, but our plans with the growth that we've talked about, we will continue even in the face of higher supply costs to expand operating margins in that segment."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Adam Tindle Got it. And maybe as a follow-up Greg, I'm going to take a stab since it's been in the public domain on Airwave, any potential comments you could make on developments, investors have long considered you kind of double hedged because of both Airwave and ESN, but wondering if they should be considering the potential risk of losing that hedge? And secondly, you're not afraid to get creative. I'm just wondering if there's maybe any sort of alternative ownership structures, like a JV or something like that, that you're considering. So I know it's a tough topic, but anything that you can give us would be helpful. ."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Brown I appreciate the question. So just to remind you, I think, Adam, that the contract for Airwave runs through all of next year through 2022. ESN under its current construct runs through all of 2024. We've been in active conversations with the UK home office. They have expressed the desire to extend the Airwave contract. That's underpinned the ongoing conversations we've had. We also obviously are involved with the CMA and are adhering to the process that they've outlined. I think the process will take several months. It will go into well into 2022. There's really nothing more to say on it, on that front, other than we continue to make the investments in the network as well, to keep it current, to keep it reliable, the service levels to the end user customer, and no disruption to that are the absolute utmost importance. And we'll continue the dialogue with both the UK home office and the CMA, and, I am hopeful that we'll have constructive outcomes, but we'll see how it plays out over the next several months. But I do appreciate you bringing it up."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Trevor Bowers Hi, this is Trevor filling in for Keith. Have a couple of questions about this supply chain. So how have the supply chain challenges evolved since the last quarter? Do you expect them to worsen before improving or would -- from your perspective, would you say the supply chain challenges are peaked?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler And I'd also add in terms of what we're doing to manage through a difficult environment. Number one, we're prioritizing our customer needs, and that starts with public safety. Additionally, Motorola has world-class engineering across the organization. Jack's team is helping think through alternative designs where engineers very quickly find parts that are available when one part is constrained. So our teams are doing a good job there. Each one of us here on the call have supplier relationships that we have C level dialogues going on so that we can get our allocations. And finally, we're carrying higher inventory as well to manage the environment."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Louie DiPalma Greg, Jason, Mahesh, Jack, and Tim, . Excellent. LMR product revenue increased by a healthy 12% this quarter after an 18% increase last quarter, despite the referenced supply chain issues, can you give us a sense on what you think your penetration is for your APX NEXT radio, your MXP600 Tetra. And you were recently announced MOTOTRBO. I think you launched the APX next in the fall of 2019. So a lot of investors are just wondering, like, what inning are we in for the respective upgrade cycles for these different product refreshes that you have had over the past couple of years?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Brown So Louie, first let's attack the APX NEXT piece. It's very early days. We're really, really pleased. So we announced it in '19, obviously last year during the COVID year, I would say, we had -- the market was somewhat stalled in the first and second quarter. We've seen a significant ramp up in terms of orders since then. But all day long we've talked about, you've heard me make mentioned before. This is typically a three to five-year cycle where we start getting some material, a refresh within our customers base U.S. about an inning. I'd say we're in the top of the second inning potentially. We have room to run here in terms of APX NEXT. The second question was related to the MXP600 in Europe and it's again, very early days. We've had some market success. But the interesting thing to point out for both the APX NEXT, as well as the MXP is those were designed for very high tier part of the market. So that's attractive, but the reality is we're going to be feathering in mid-tier and entry tier on both the APX NEXT line, as well as the MXP line. So we're really encouraged by that because that starts to get to the need of the market, so to speak. So I think that answers your question."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Louie DiPalma . And you spoke about the supply chain headwind persisting through the first half of 2022. Do you think these issues results in a deceleration in the recent revenue rate or should we forecast for like sustained revenue growth for the next three quarters?
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler No, Louie, I think our comments or my comments around the linearity that we're planning for reflect our views of the supply chain, particularly for Q1 in the first half of next year, limiting our ability to fulfill the very good demand that's there and yes, for things to improve in the second half and to have a good year that Greg mentioned of planning for about 7% in total revenue growth."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Silverstein  guys. I appreciate you taking the questions. First off, if I miss it, I apologize. But what was the supply chain impact in Q3 and what do you expect it to be in Q4 in terms of quantifying it, both the revenue impact and the margin impact?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Brown So in terms of Q3 our results and the growth that we had except for PCR which was limited in its ability we were able to match the supply with the demand pretty well in Q3, as we look to Q4 and the constraints that we have in embedded in our guidance for the year and therefore Q4 about $100 million of revenue is limited. That could have been there we had the requisite supply, that's our current estimate. In terms of an impact to Q4 that said, we're still growing er than we thought and guided to last time now, 10 to 10.25. Bu t that $100 million is our current estimate as to have we had a better supply, what more we could have done in Q4?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Silverstein Jason, am I doing the math, right? That's about if I translate that to an EPS, it's about an -- it's about $0.10 impact."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Brown It depends on the mix and a large part of that's PCR. So it's probably a little left of center. But in general, you can do the math as you've done around, what does contribution could be at? I'd add further color aro und the supply chain costs that we are seeing in order to get the requisite supply. There are increasing costs. I mentioned freight before many companies like us are facing higher freight costs, the number that we're embedding in the P&L this year for higher premiums is nearly $45 million on the year was a lot of that in the second half. And then as I looked at Q4 and the plans we put together for Q4 having to buy and get these materials, not only through expedited freight, but also through other means through brokers and distribution and the like is adding about $20 million of pressure to what we had planned for Q4. So those things are in the mix too. We're doing what's necessary to get the supply that we can get."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Silverstein Jason, I apologize. You're expecting $20 million pressure in Q4 from freight costs or from elevated component costs?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler The components' is the $20 million number in Q4. Freight is an annual number. Paul that we've been bearing all along and on its annual basis, it's $45 million, about $20 million in the first half and $25 million in the second half, that's the freight higher costs. The ocean and air both are exorbitant prices right now. And we're having to mix two more faster delivery methods, which is causing a higher freight cost as well."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Silverstein All right. But it sounds like it's a 1% to 1.5%, if I assume a $10 million to $15 million impact in Q4 from freight, it's about $30 million, $35 million all in, it looks like it's about 1.5 percentage point adverse impact, if I did the math, right?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Jason Winkler Yes. I think you're in the zip code.
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Silverstein All right. I appreciate it. It sounds pretty meaningful between revenue margins, not surprisingly? My other questions is also clarifications, you always said that if I remember correctly, I think you said public sector video in Q2 had hit a $330 plus million run rate, annual run rate of from $300 million previously. I'm hoping you could update us. And I think similarly you'd said mobile cameras, body-worn cameras in 2Q was up 80% year-over-year, that was an acceleration over 60% previously. I was hoping you could update that growth, right?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jack Molloy Paul, with body-worn so record unit shipments in Q3, really pleased with that. We've talked about as active customers, our customers want that alternative. We think we filled that really well. The other thing I'd say is, we're uniquely positioned internationally, given our scale and global presence. We talked about the French NOI they've actually put subsequent orders into Q3. Mahesh just referenced M500. So we think we're in a good position right now in body-worn car."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Silverstein All right. Just one -- last quick one for me. In terms of pricing environment in supply constraints, I'd be surprised, if it got worse and it won't be a surprise, it got better, but any insight you can set and what you're seeing competitively?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler Yes. We've been looking carefully at our portfolio throughout the year. We've made a few surgical adjustments in LMR primarily in North America and also in fixed video. We'll continue to look at that. Another opportunity for us is we have constant new product releases and oftentimes as Jack mentioned, APX NEXT, for example. We typically release at the higher part of the portfolio. And with that presents a mix opportunity to offset some of the costs that we discussed earlier. So we'll continue to look at it carefully, and of course, monitoring, what is a very competitive in market that we're in both LMR and fixed video."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ben Bollin . , everyone.  for taking my question, Greg or Jack, I was hoping you could take us through a little bit about what you're seeing with Ame rica rescue plan funding to date, how you think it might've manifested thus far. And then the second part of the question is, I'd be interested in any thoughts you have about how customers are looking at this money within each piece of your business. So within surveillance radio and even command center, how you think it's influencing their behavior. That's it for me. ."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Brown And Ben when you total up those buckets within the rescue plan that Jack just described, it's over a $0.5 trillion that is available to our end users, $350 billion in state and local, by the way, that's multi-year and goes through the end of '24. So hence why we both see and believe that the environment multi-year and what we're seeing in the pipeline is pretty good."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Fahad Najam  for taking my question. First, a clarification, can you remind me what revenue was from acquisitions in the quarter?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler Yes. In total, I'll give it to you by a segment real quick. It was -- in products, it was $12 million and in services and software, it was only $3 million."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Fahad Najam Appreciate it. . Now to my question, if I look at your LMR business overall, well, PSI sales, if we accelerated the software and services and tax rate coming and remains in the $550 million, $545 million quarterly run rate, should we see kind of like an increase in the software services from the increased product from the increased PSI sales in future quarters? Is it just because you're selling new equipment and the software services hasn't quite attached to it yet? So we should expect some meaningful acceleration in software and services revenue for LMR in fiscal '22?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler So Fahad, this year for products, for example, we're expecting mid to high, probably closer to high-single-digit growth services and software is low double digits. There is some leading indicator as products grow you're right. There's some services attached to it that come after the sale, the bulk, however, of our services and software growth is around not product attacks, task, but rather command center software, video software and things like software upgrade programs and the likes that are on existing install bases. So those are the key drivers within S&S. It's less product attached. It's more the unique offerings we have in the value propositions around services and software that are driving the low double digit growth in services and software."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Fahad Najam Got it. And then same question on the video surveillance there the software services portion of the video surveillance market is clearly growing a lot faster? I'm just trying to understand the dynamics there. What's driving the software attach rates or services in video versus PSI sales? I just kind of try to help us understand the dynamics there, please."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jack Molloy And the last thing Fahad, I'd say on that is, you hear Greg talk a lot about acquisitions. I'll hit again on Envysion. That's approximately $25 million in recurring revenue. There you think about Openpath which is an access control recurring revenue model access control. And so there were re-envisioning that business as well. So I just -- those are other things that really are more software driven, recurring revenue model business, and that's really where we're pushing the business."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Erik Lapinski Hi team. This is Erik on for Meta.  for taking our question and congrats on another  quarter. You understand this is a small dealer relative to everything else, but maybe if we could dive in a little bit on the command center deal, you saw with the City of Yonkers, I'm wondering like what drove their upgrade to command central was that timing of refresh with what they already had. Were they looking to integrate their body-camera deployment? And then you also noted to fix the video portion of that. Are they integrating fixed a video into the command central deployment? And are there other similar deals in the pipeline that you're looking at that you can work with customers maybe as they take advantage of some of their funding?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mahesh Saptharishi Yes, I think you can think about this -- across the incident life cycle. We have products today that touch on every aspect of that incident lifecycle, a fixed video from Avigilon really gives you that pre-incident view, but also gives you that view during the incident integrated into or being management solution, but also coming into our command central aware platform as well. Then you have CommandCentral suite products across the board. Then you have vigilant ALPR solution. That was part of that equation as well, to enable fast investigations. Leveraging both the fixed camera solution, but also ALPR cameras as well, body-worn cameras feeding into that same evidence platform adding to the mix and then mass notification was also part of the story there. So all that together, it really gives you a view of an integration between those products really enabling effective incident response. And I think that was the value to Yonkers."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Erik Lapinski . And I mean, when you just see the market and those types of deals, do you expect more of a consolidation that way? It seems that it would make sense, but also understand not everyone is tech. Is that tech savvy as maybe their police chief? What can you do from a sales motion perspective to kind of bring in more deals like that?"
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mahesh Saptharishi I'll just add to that. Just after that so 75% of our orders in Q3 were either new customers' ordering more than one of our platforms or adding to existing Motorola Solutions, really leveraging that tight integration between them all."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jim Suva . Mine will be pretty easy. The first one is Greg, you said  something in my ears, didn't quite catch it. So maybe you can clarify, you said really preliminary, preliminary, really early looks for next year. I heard a 7% then I think I heard a 10%, but I wasn't sure if you're breaking down product services or company-wide, if you could just clarify that, then I have one other little clarification."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Brown Sure. Jim. Yes, no. I was talking about 7% revenue growth in 2022 full company view and then software and services being around 10% revenue growth within that envelope. That's kind of what we see at this point in time. And then the details and more color we'd give a quarter from now."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jim Suva So that was easy. My second easy part is, and then I'll b e done. Your outlook, you raised your revenues for the full year and for Q4, but then the EPS you raised it, but not as much as the EPS beat, is that all attributed to additional shipping costs? Or is there something else in Q4 as to why earnings wouldn't be as much as the beat that just we had in Q3? ."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Winkler Jim, it's Jason. It's some of what I discussed earlier with Paul around supply chain costs, but additionally, it is higher OpEx in Q4 for funding the two acquisitions that we just brought into the fold of Openpath exactly and Envysion, which is driving our envelope to 1950 for the year. Those are -- we're very happy to fund those within the OpEx line,  companies. That's also a factoring into the math that you're doing."
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Jim Suva . And  so much for the details on the calls.
4465820,Motorola Solutions,MSI,11/5/2021,CEO Greg Brown on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Greg Brown , Jim. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional or closing remarks. . Listen, I just want to say  to the whole management team, but also to all the employees in MSI. I mean, there's so many good things going on, but it's a tough environment. I want to thank the people on the frontline, the sales organization, that's really executing well and contributing to Q3 record backlogs supply. You hear it with every company. You hear it all the time, but the supply chain environment, as we said, challenging in Q3, remains challenging in Q4. And I just think the team here in mixing and matching and there's more fluidity and uncertainty in supply chain in Q3 and Q4 than we've had in prior periods. And I think the adaptability staying in touch and close touch with key suppliers. I appreciate all that. Everybody on the support teams and back office and support functions in particularly HR and Karen Dunning and Terry Bell, because we have, it's a tough environment. We have vaccine mandate compliance requirements. We're always following rules and regulations by facility and by state and Karen and Terry, Mark Hacker phenomenal. I'm thrilled with Q3 and the results across the board. I'm proud that we're able to for three consecutive quarters' raise top and bottom line. And I think we're really well positioned going into 2022, despite the challenges we have, but we'll stick together, like we always do. We'll be flexible and will continue to be steadfast and focused. And I appreciate everybody's contribution onward and upward. And  everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the internet in approximately three hours. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor."
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Salveen Richter For 2022, can you walk through the supply aspects. Are you still guiding to up to 3 billion doses here? And can you also speak to demand dynamics? Is there upside to the guidance that you've commented on today for future signed APAs. And then secondly, how confident are you that you can fix these supply issues and over what time frame?"
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Harrison Two for me this morning. So, first, can we just spend a moment on myocarditis. And I think the overlying question here is, why do you think the regulator is more concerned with your vaccine in younger age groups compared to Pfizer, which has obviously already been approved in younger age groups. And then related to that, how much of an impact is this having on uptake and distribution of your vaccine given that we see Pfizer continue to highlight potential differences and bringing that to government's attention? And then secondly, on flu, can you just comment on how you're going to interpret these results? Obviously, we're just going to get titer results. But I think it's your premise that you can achieve a much higher efficacy flu vaccine compared to traditional flu vaccines. So do you think there is a clear correlation in titers to efficacy? And what level of titers would demonstrate very high efficacy?"
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Tenthoff My question has to do with the emerging orphan disease pipeline. And I've been really impressed by the progress that you guys are making there in these important patients. And I think the mRNA technology just suits ideally here. So, what do you see as sort of the plans over the next couple of years. Kind of take us forward a little bit. What could this pipeline look like? And maybe you can just give us a sense of where you think Moderna will be in the orphan disease setting in a couple of years."
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Hoge I'll take that too. So, first, I think we're very excited about the programs that are already in the clinical space, either already dosing patients or about to start. And so, I think the most important thing is looking forward to next year, the demonstration, we would hope, of proof of concept in that rare disease modality. As you know, we are dosing quite a large number of folks in propionic acidemia and we've been dosing in methylmalonic acidemia. With the opening of the GSD1a IND, we'd hope to be following a short order there. So, all three of those are potentials for us to demonstrate the real proof that this technology can be used to correct inborne errors of metabolism in these populations. I'll also note that there's a quite a wide range of disease going down to as young as two years of age in some of the organic acidemias and also the older adults in some of the GSD1a program. So, we're going to be demonstrating quite a lot there. Crigler Najjar presents another opportunity for that proof-of-concept as well as the PKU program when that moves forward, but those are still in preclinical, as I said. So the question is what do we do on the back of that proof-of-concept from any one or all of those programs. What you've seen us do in respiratory vaccines and in vaccines generally is probably the best predictor of how we will respond, which is, as you know, there are a very, very la rge number of metabolic diseases that could be addressed to deliver through mRNA therapy. We could list off large groups, the urea cycle of disorders, other organic acidemias, so many beyond that. And even in moving into more broadly present metabolic diseases. So, what we would do is we would define that systemic intracellular therapeutic modality as a core modality, just like we did with vaccines a couple of years ago. And that would cause us to dramatically expand that pipeline. Now I can assure you we're looking at those programs in research right now, but we have held back on moving them into preclinical development and putting them on our pipeline until we've seen the modalities perform. So that is probably the most important thing for me, looking at the rare and orphan disease space over the course of the coming year, is when do we cross that threshold and then, ultimately, when do we expand dramatically that pipeline of programs."
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Yee Two questions. One is just trying to clarify guidance. I think there's some confusion around guidance. So I would love to understand some clarification. You lowered 2021 a little bit, I think, by $5 billion, but raised 2022 by $5 billion. Is that a timing shift of deliveries? And how much of that is just option contracts as you think about 2022 because you've talked about APAs as firm commitments. I'm just trying to understand how much are commitments versus acceptances and how to think about those two. And then on flu. Following up on the flu question, I think people are looking at labels and looking at fold increases and seroconversion rates of four to seven times and 50 to 60% seroconversion rates. Are those accurate numbers? Are those numbers we should be looking at and comparing to? Maybe you could just help us qualify that because I think that's what people are  trying to do."
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gena Wang I have two regarding the COVID vaccine. And the first question is, given the supply restraints, do you see 100-microgram doses being used as 250-microgram doses. And then also, any hesitance due to safety concerns? We did see a few countries put a cautionary action on Moderna vaccine. And my second question is, in the US, if we do the math, you completed delivery of 300 million doses and then US exercised total doses of 410 million for 2021 and the 90 million doses in first quarter 2022. So, just wondering how much of the remaining 110 million doses in 4Q 2021 will flow through next year."
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Cory Kasimov Two for me as well. So, first of all, in terms of the 2022 APAs that you outlined, are the $17 billion worth of existing contracts constructed as firm commitments or do countries have – the contracts have optionality embedded in them wherein countries don't necessarily have to take the full amount depending on the evolution of the pandemic. And then, my second question is, given your comments on the call about potentially moving into the endemic phase by the second half of next year, should we think about 2022 revenue as being weighted towards the first half of the year?"
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Geoff Meacham I just had one more on the flu program, maybe for Stephen. It's highly likely that you'll see an increase in antibody titers. I was just thinking for the combo study, though, with 1273, what other factors do you need to address to de-risk that study? And just, I guess, I'm trying to determine how to optimize the regimen by things like dose titration or even selecting the population by more urgent need for the COVID booster side of things."
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stephen Hoge What we're going to be looking at in the combinations are actually the things that you just pointed to. And so, in particular, we do believe the – most of the value of respiratory vaccination in the near term boosting will be in older adults, 50-plus or 60-plus depending upon how you want to look at it. Very similar to the RSV population, certainly for the flu population and recommendations g lobally. And we think COVID moves that direction as well. And so, as we look to the first part of the question, where do we intend to optimize that ratio in immunogenicity, it really is towards those higher risk populations that do need, we think, a respiratory booster every year. When it comes to looking at the – what are the combination of things that we're going to be doing in selecting that ratio in dose, obviously, it's mostly going to be immunogenicity and the tolerability profile. Fortunately, these vaccines have been very safe to date in these older adult populations. None of the concerns that we're having about myocarditis really exists in the 50 plus, 60 plus populations. And so, we feel very confident on the overall safety profile. But the question will be, where are we in optimizing the immunogenicity against endpoints that are pretty well validated now in COVID, and where are we against the immunogenicity against endpoints that are also broadly accepted in influenza. We will be doing this for a range of different – it's a four-strain, seasonal strain vaccine. And so, we'll want to make sure there's no interference between those and that we're able to achieve strong balance immunity across the four flu strains plus the COVID vaccine. I think we have approximate targets based on the immunogenicity we saw from Phase III and the immunogenicity we're seeing in the booster studies. But the open question is are we going to need all of that for the COVID portion of our vaccine going forward. And so, we'll continue to follow over time whether we see more durable protection and, therefore, you might be able to optimize further that dose, if there was a reason to do so. And then, the second part is with the seasonal annual flu component. We just want to understand, particularly in the older adult population where flu vaccines have had less clear efficacy every season, is maybe the way I'll say it, and there is an opportunity for improvement by raising those titers. We're going to want to look to whether or not we need to get those titers above what have been achieved by others. And I'll note that there's a precedent even for high dose flu vaccines in that market that have been differentiated on price and grabbing market share. And so, it could cause us to look in that 60-plus or 50-plus population at really indexing more to those flu antigens and making sure that we exceed or at least achieve that similar high degree of seroconversion there. So, those are the factors that we'll look at around the 1073 program that we've announced. We're looking at a range of ratios. Fortunately, we're going to have experience. We already have experience in flu and COVID from our prior work, and it will be a demonstration, we hope, of the ability to combine vaccines. I will note, as a final comment, we have done combination respiratory vaccines in the past, including in adults with the 1653 program. And so, we do have a basis, we're beginning to think, about how we might combine those antigens going forward. But ultimately, we'll let the 1073 study and the early clinical experiences there be confirmatory around this. We have a question from Joseph Stringer from Needham."
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joseph Stringer Two from us. Just curious on the guidance for – the 2 billion guidance for the US fall 2022 booster market. Can you help us understand what assumptions are sort of built into that number? Is that based on sort of your internal expectations around a relative percentage of individuals that would – fully vaccinated individuals that would get a booster or just trying to handicap what the variance could be around that. And then, for CMV, can you give us a sense for the relative timelines for enrollment of that Phase III trial and when we could see the initial data from that?"
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mani Foroohar A couple of quick ones. Can you give us a sense of when we might see, if any, the impact of pricing shift to increase deliveries to low and middle income countries that Stéphane mentioned. Is that something that we'd start to see a little bit of early next year? Is that more of a 4Q phenomenon in terms of the budgetary timing and sort of quarterly contract that Stéphane talked about. Secondarily, I have a few small piggy jack question on the numbers. On slide 15, the $6.7 billion in deposits, that presumably all for APAs for 2021 or 2022? Or does some of that apply to APAs for delivery – for contracts for 2023. Thirdly, your CapEx guidance a little lower than it was last Q. Is that $50 million to $150 million that you took out of that, is that absolute savings? Or is that just going to get pushed into next year as some of the contract revenues were? And then finally, a little more substantive of a question. How much perspective can you give us on you potentially compete for share on contracting in EU, the competitor Pfizer/BioNTech locked in pretty large contracts on volume for the next two years? Is there an opportunity for you guys to start capturing more share [indiscernible] relevant in the EU? And last, and finally, we talked on the last quarter about potentially access to China market where you guys are essentially not existing at this point. And you have mentioned going there via JV. Can you give us an update on status of your ability to access that market, discussion of the JV to compete with BionTech/Fosun? Sorry for the barrage of questions, and s."
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Meline In terms of the deposits, the $6.7 billion we have in hand, I would just say the preponderance of those deposits are for deliveries either in 2021 and in 2022. There may be some small amounts in 2023, but it's pretty early in terms of the contracting there. Secondly, in terms of CapEx, I think the answer is yes, you can expect, as I said – we're going to see a notable increase in our CapEx next year. But generally, in terms of the reduction this year, it's a combination of things moving into the first quarter of next year and also we're running, in some cases, at or below the estimated investment requirements. So it's a combination of those two."
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mani Foroohar On potential China JV, I know you guys have mentioned it in the last call, I don't know if there's been any progress?"
4465980,"Moderna, Inc.",MRNA,11/5/2021,CEO StÃ©phane Bancel on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Stéphane Bancel Yes. So nothing to announce today, but [indiscernible] in China. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Stéphane Bancel. Well,  very much, everybody, for joining us. And if you have any further questions, you know where to reach Lavina and the team. Have a  day. Bye. This concludes today's conference call.  for joining. You may now disconnect."
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steve Sakwa . . Shankh, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the occupancy trend that you're expecting into the fourth quarter. I realize that things are maybe seasonally slowing down as we move into the holidays, but I'm just wondering if the trends you've seen in October, into early part of November, what are sort of the risks that you see to hitting the guidance that you've put out there?"
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Amanda Sweitzer . . Can you help frame up how you're thinking about the potential magnitude of sharp price increases next year a bit more, either in terms of current implied loss to lease in the portfolio, or the pricing pre -owned that you expect the portfolio to achieve relative to the industry?"
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,John Pelusi . Maybe just one follow-up to that conversation there. Could you share what rent increases you're currently sending out today?
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nick Joseph Best operators will rise, just on expense, labor pressures. Are you saying that it across all of the operators? Is it across all geographies or are there any differences that you're seeing either from strategy or from location or any other factor?"
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Mueller Yeah. Hi. I was just curious, what's fourth-quarter guidance assumed for show labor cost trends? Any improvement whatsoever or just kind of a continuation of increased but on a full-quarter impact?"
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Juan Sanabria . Just hoping you could talk to pricing for new customers in the market today. I recognize the intention is for the industry and for Welltower operators to push come [Indiscernible] 1 or on the 12-month anniversary. But curious how pricing trends are faring for new customers across the industry or across your portfolio.
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Derek Johnston Hi, . The $5.6 billion of investments over the past year really stands out, how much of this would you consider opportunistic driven by the pandemic, versus perhaps in a normal Welltower growth that would have happened anyway? And is this level of investment repeatable going forward? How much more capacity do you have to get through the investment process and take advantage of this market?"
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tayo Okusanya , everyone. In your recent business update, as an interesting slide here, that shows your shop portfolio on the power of diversity. I'm just kind of curious. Shankh earlier on mentioned ultimately you expect the winners and losers and the senior housing space over the next few years. So that suggest that we start to see a little bit more concentration going forward across Acuity geography on operating model based on who you believe winners will be? Or should we still expect to see real diversification across Acuity and monthly rents with the idea being you just pick the best players at each point on this graph?"
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rich Hill Hey, , guys. Hey Shankh, you had a really interesting sliding deck about historical affect the revenue relative to inflation. And as I listen to you talk and listen to you saying that this is a different cycle in past, it does strike me that that maybe the outperformance versus inflation could be even higher this time. Could you maybe talk about that over the medium to long term and how you think about that?"
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Carroll Yes, . I want to go back to the street rates answer that you provided earlier. I guess what's the reasoning that the seniors housing street rate growth is increasing at a faster clip than the renewal growth? Are street rates slower right now than those existing rates and it's just that gap's closing or is there something different there that I'm not thinking about?"
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jordan Sadler . . Shankh, I wanted to just talk about some of the new things we saw this quarter, heard on the call and a couple of things that popped out to me, where in the CCRCs that you purchased during the quarter, and then separately when I heard you talking about John, you mentioned the ability to do redevelopment and real estate value-add opportunities. So, could you expand on these 2 pieces? 1. Just the interest level in the -- our increased interest level in the entrance fee communities and the return profile for those types of assets? And then maybe what specifically, or maybe even generically, you're thinking in terms of redevelopment or value add dollars or opportunities."
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rich Anderson I'm going after John Burkart here. So, John, welcome to the call."
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rich Anderson The comments you made about some of the things that you want to apply to the business from your experience in multi-family, I just wanted to touch on a couple. I know you're not going to give away the secret sauce now, but revenue management and some of the multi-family tech initiatives that have been the name of the game in that business for a while now. isn't revenue management only as good as it's fully kind of used in the industry. So, if you're using revenue management and no one else is, it's sort of not useless, but certainly not as effective. So how do you get the word out on using revenue management? How much is it being used in the industry? And then also in the tech initiatives, how much is that out there already -- There, I think you can make a real difference relative to your peers. I just wanted to see if I can get some color from you on those 2 topics. ."
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,John Burkart Certainly. And it's Chalk would tell you got two questions is.
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nick Yulico . I just wanted to go back to the expense topic and how to think about labor because it was up 4% year-over-year in the third quarter, the occupancy was down a bit. So maybe that's an unusual relationship, but just trying to understand how we should think about labor expenses going forward because it doesn't seem like that is the pressure that's going to abate anytime soon. I mean, you talked about agency labor. Maybe, I'm a little bit confused why that use of agency labor would be reduced going forward if it's still a challenging time to be hiring people. And maybe you can just go to triangulate how you guys are thinking about labor when you talk about Shankh, your comment that shop margin will be higher than that of pre-COVID. Eventually, you give IRR calculations, which assumed something presumably about margin, labor, expenses. Maybe you can just give us a feel for how you guys are really underwriting labor as an expense going forward."
4465981,Welltower Inc.,WELL,11/5/2021,CEO Shankh Mitra on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Shankh Mitra Fantastic. I would highly recommend you go back and read the script, and you will see that we have detailed that out in our prepared remarks as well as in the other -- answering other questions. But I'll try to summarize it. First, you have to understand the confluence of factors having. Just purely focused on the labor side in the quarter. You people didn't travel for 18 months. And then that's the first time you've got a lot of PTOs being taken and that what caused a very significant demand because our operators provide PTOs, right? So, you've got a significant surge of that. That's sort of understands our one aspect of what happens, 2), you got one extra day in the quarter. You get paid by obviously daily basis, but you get revenue in most cases on a monthly basis, that's second point. Third, you have to understand that when -- because of the rise of COVID, people are extra cautious. There's a reason there is no COVID in the communities. You've got sniffles and you called in and you should have called in. But at that last moment look at the spike of the COVID through the quarter, majority of the we got obviously problems in July, but then we got a massive spike as you followed the COVID curve through August and September. We're on the other side of that, right? That's why if you put all of this together then obviously follow the opt-in state versus opt-out state comment that John made. You'll understand it's not a question of optimism, we're actually seeing it. That we're on the other end of it. But only time will say, obviously how that exactly plays out, how much time that takes. But if you follow all these comments that we made, you can put together that picture pretty clearly. Nice, I would just add, if you look that compensation was Basis points year-over-year. So, to your point, occupancy a bit down still seeing compensation cost up, there is real base wage inflation. But the driver of that 4.1% year-over-year expense growth, the lion's share of it is being driven by agency. . There are no further questions at this time and that does conclude our conference call. You may now disconnect. ."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Elyse Greenspan Hi, . . My first question -- when you guys -- when Peter -- when you make the comments do you think you'll hit sub-90 for full-year 2022, and then you said that there would be runway for further improvement in future years. I'm just trying -- when you think 2022 and beyond, what are you guys assuming for both pricing and loss trend as we think out the next year and even beyond that timeframe?"
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Zaffino Well, , Elyse. Let me answer the first part of why we're so confident that the momentum that we have and the sub-90 combined ratio is achievable. When you look at this quarter and last quarter, just the improvement from the core of the businesses continues to improve at an accelerated pace. And David McElroy and the leadership team on the underwriting side, Shane, who is now going to move in the CFO role, driving AIG 200, just the execution has been terrific. And why we're confident, it's just again, the momentum when we look at the fundamentals of the business, we're growing top-line. We talked Mark and I about that we're getting pricing above loss costs, developing margin, expense ratio. All of that goes into our confidence. We have higher retention on a policy count, very strong new business and thins that apply to quality, we have more relevance each quarter in the marketplace. And so the assumptions are modest. It's not that it has to stay in the same pricing environment, but it is one that we're going to continue to be very disciplined of driving profitability and making sure that where we are deploying capital, that on a risk-adjusted basis, we're going to be getting margin. So I think that -- again, I don't want to give guidance beyond that, but feel that next year we have the momentum, we're executing on all of our strategic imperatives, and we're delivering the results."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Elyse Greenspan Okay, . And then my follow-up, you guys said that the Life IPO should take place in the Q1, perhaps in the second quarter of next year, how do we think about capital return? I know you guys have laid out a plan for this year, but how should we think about capital return on next year? And is that dependent on when, and the ultimate size of what you bring to market with the Life and Retirement business in the IPO?"
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Zaffino We've been trying to give a lot of guidance in terms of what we intend to do in the short run because of a number of moving pieces. We have strong liquidity, which is what we had talked about in the prepared remarks. Some of the big moving pieces as we get to the back-half of the year will be the affordable housing proceeds, the closing of Blackstone, the fact that we're going to continue to execute on debt reduction, share repurchases. And I think as we get to the fourth quarter call and we have a better line of sight in terms of what we think the actual timing will be on the IPO plus liquidity at year-end, we'll give further guidance as we move forward. But for now, I think we're just going to stick with what we've outlined and we continue to execute on that each quarter."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Meyer Shields . I guess -- first question for Peter. You laid out pretty conservative case for the frequency and severity of catastrophes. How should we think about what Validus Re is interested in writing in that context?
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Zaffino , Meyer. Well, I mean, Validus Re, since we've acquired them, we have not increased risk appetite, and as a matter of fact, they take a very  conservative position in terms of their net. So I think that was evidenced in the quarter in terms of our overall CAT number, that's number 1. I think Chris Schaper and the team have done a terrific job of diversification on the portfolio, so we've reduced our aggregates in peak zones such as Florida significantly from the original portfolio that we acquired. We're getting better balance in the portfolio across the world. And that's with multiple parallels and multiple geographies. So I think that that continuation of that strategy of getting balanced diversification and making sure that we're not taking significant nets in the portfolio and making sure that we're driving risk-adjusted returns as we look to?1, 1?, is going to be very important for Validus Re, but we've been executing on that throughout the year."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Meyer Shields Okay, understood. . And then as a follow-up for Mark, is there any way of describing the, I mean, you made a very strong case for conservatism in the current accident year loss pace, and I'm wondering how you're thinking about that level of conservatism in recent accident years as of 9/30?"
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Phillips . . I will be two quick ones, I think. Mark, your comments on, again, the loss pick thing. Number 2 was I think about while the current stuff and its long tail ed and actively derisk, and so we're going to be conservative when, it looks like the industry. I think that was your number 2. Can you tell us, has there been any shift in your book, given everything else you guys have done, from occurrence to claims made in the commercial lines of books. Anything noteworthy that would shift away from occurrence to claims made?"
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Zaffino , Michael. So I would say there's only a handful that are really claim today, right? It's management liability, it's professional indemnity that really drive it and actually super to ugh product liability [Indiscernible] cases are really [Indiscernible]. It's one thing to shift at growth, that's another thing to shift at net, right? So as we've used different reinsurances over time, that changes the proportions. So I -- we're comfortable with the mix of a currency claims made. There's growth in Financial Lines, as Peter pointed out, and there's some growth in Excess Casualty, the nets are somewhat different. But we think appropriate for what we've done."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Phillips Okay, perfect. . And then maybe just a real quick pointed one, too, on the last question to today's answers in the professional lines. There's clearly lots of concerns in the past 18 months or so because of securities class actions and IPOs and specs. Would you say, given all of Dave 's comments there that you think your exposure to that type of risk is pretty limited?"
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mark Lyons Yeah, I think how Dave explained it is the way the business actually flows, business actually works. The key thing is upfront identifying the right classes and the right risk which they've really done, I think, exceptionally well. And then the second is what goes through the court systems, given that you have FCAs, even though we are massively reduced in the FCA. You know, you've got to go through all the motions to dismiss and other -- another procedural that take you there. So that's what Dave's comment about 3 plus, 3 to 5 years has to work its way through the court system. But given our reduced exposure, back to a similar answer, that makes us feel so strongly about the recent accident year."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joshua Shanker At a risk of being labeled a pariah, I'm going to go back to the D&O questions a little bit. Can we talk a little about the accident year picks? Not necessarily early for AIG or [indiscernible] What sort of combined ratios were 16, 17, 18 producing in retrospect, we've seen tremendous pricing come through. Is D&O business broadly for the industry written in those years, being written at a substantial underwriting loss? And the extent to which you took the reserve charges in this quarter, a lot of the business I assume was syndicated. Are the syndicate feeling the same kind of thing that you are? And are you getting ahead of what you think are losses to come?"
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Mcelroy Yeah, . , Mark and Josh. Yeah, the only thing I would say there is that you've seen a lot of variability in the scheduled piece in terms of portfolios over the years. There can be 40-to-50-point differences consistent way. So that speaks to risk selection in the portfolios. But that said, there's definitely verticality that's been happening in those years. That is showing up in the 2019 and 2022, 2020 years, because the courts did not close for this motion dismiss, and the securities class action. So, in fact, if you look at Cornerstone, there were equal number of settlements in 2020 during COVID that there were in 2019. So verticality still exists in this business, market cap loss, disclosed damages, and what that happens. So I think there's a lot of immaturity in those years that will continue to show up because the cases are still fermenting. There's a 3-to-5-year window on these claims made. It  all ties to the motion to dismiss but they continue to be argued. I think what we saw was a lot of them were argued and then when they are decided on the client's behalf, then you start negotiating settlements, okay? If the Company wins, they normally go away, therapeutics or defense costs. But that's still an unknown in that '16 to '18 cohort year as the verticality of loss for those cases, okay? A number of them got settled in '20, there's a number that are still getting settled in '21, and there's still be a number that will be settled in '22."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Joshua Shanker I'm going to hold it to 1 question for you guys. And just congratulations on everyone's new role.
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Zaffino And if it is a financial question on the Financial Lines, It'll be the last one because I'm going to have to turn it over to Dave again."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Brian Meredith I'll give you a broader-based one. Peter, if I look at the return on attributed equity for the General Insurance Business right now, you had some corporate cost there. It's still below a double-digit return on equity. I guess my question is, is that your goal to achieve a double-digit ROE in that business? And what is the underlying combined ratio you need to be in order to achieve that given the current  catastrophe outlook and interest rate environment?"
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Zaffino , Brian. As we've David in the past and I really have the same answer which is we're really focused on driving the profitability, earnings, reducing volatility. We're making  progress from the combined ratio. Looking at the investment portfolio over time to have less volatility on the property and casualty side. We're working through the separation and it's hard to give you an answer in terms of the absolute combined ratio and returns until we know all the math in terms of the numerator and denominator, meaning we had just needed a little bit more time over the next couple of quarters to separate Life Retirement, have the path of the IPO and the capital structure that will outline in more detail for you. But we know that that is an important guidance in terms of when we are in future state, and we'll work towards that. But I think now with the number of moving pieces between the 9.9% in terms of what we're doing to setup the IPO. And what we're doing with General Insurance in terms of growth. We see a lot of opportunities to grow with margin and with improved combined rate shields over time. And so that's really the primary focus now and that giving the ROE guidance, once we know the variables a little bit more fixed, we can do that."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Brian Meredith That's fair, . And then just one other, this quick one. Have you done any work or maybe just in general perspective on what LDTI could mean for your life insurance business?"
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Zaffino Well, we are in progress of implementing the new standards and working through it. And so we're analyzing the guidance that's been issued today. Formulating approach, we know that we have the IPO coming up, so we have enormous number of resources on it, but it's really just too early for us to provide the estimates. But it's a key area of focus for the Company, and one that will give guidance as we get in subsequent quarters."
4466000,"American International Group, Inc.",AIG,11/5/2021,CEO Peter Zaffino on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Peter Zaffino , Brian. I think that's going to wrap it. Look, I really appreciate it -- appreciate the time. I want to thank all of our colleagues for all the  work and hope everybody has a  day. . And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do  for your participation and you may now disconnect."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith  and  for the time the opportunities. Look forward to seeing many of you. Hey, . So perhaps just to kick things off, can we go back to the solar CAPEX in some of the shifts here? I obviously, you kind of alluded to it, but I want to make this a little bit more explicit. The shift and In CapEx here to 24, is that just about, you know, inflation and supply chain uncertainties here in the near term? Or are there other factors, especially in the later years, whether that's, you know, 22 or 23 years that are driving it out."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"John Larsen , Julien, John here. I think you have that just a little bit of an adjustment for inflation and then of course, this time year we bring in our new refreshed CapEx. And as Robert noted, we've added a bit there with some repower and some additional resources, but I think you've got the headline on that one."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Yes, I did. You are not alone is what I'll say. But if I can actually ask that a little bit in reverse here, how are you thinking about financing it today? I mean, certainly the -- the conversation or indirect pay from several of your peers has -- has taken note, how are you thinking about this impacting your financing structure handle a more importantly, your cash flow outlook."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Robert Durian Yeah, sure, Julien. So you will see in the information that we shared in the earnings release with the CapEx table, we continue to model out a tax equity structure and that will finance roughly 25% to 45% of these solar projects with a tax equity financing partner. But to your point, we are watching the new legislation that's being proposed in the budget reconciliation bill. And if we do see some type of direct pay plus production tax credits for solar, we'll reevaluate that financing mechanism. Right now, we've got about a billion dollars of financing planned over the next five years with the tax equity structures. So that could be an opportunity for us for future rate-base growth if those provisions come to fruition through the new legislation."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,Julien Dumoulin-Smith But you're not ready to talk about what the -- should we say nearer term benefit to your cash flow metrics looks like thus far.
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"John Larsen No, I think there is still some moving targets on that, Julien, John here. But I think the net result from what we're seeing, it's very much in line with where we're going with our plan. And as Robert noted, if anything, it appears to have some favorability for both customers and investors. I think as we see that play out, we'll certainly talk more about any impacts to our plan."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. And the last quick one there, you just -- just on the shift in distribution CapEx obviously stepping up in the later years. Is there any undergrounding in there? I know we've talked about that at various points with respect to [Indiscernible] follow-up."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"John Larsen Continue to have a lot of focus on advancing underground. What we're Working on is making sure we continue to get more and more efficient. So we look at not only advancing the underground beginning efficient with each you know, unit of capital, if you will, Julien, so that's very much in there."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. Okay. Under grounding is in their alright excellent I will leave it there. T hank you, guys."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"John Larsen Very good. , Julien. That is star one, if you would like to ask a question. Well, pause for just a moment. And we'll now take a follow-up from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Hey, sorry guys. If there was going to ask this question, I might as well jump in to confirm it. Just on Duane Arnold, is that in the solar facility? Is that in the updated CapEx plants? Sorry. I'm not sure if I heard that right in the commentary. And then on the reconciliation, bill, just clarifying this, you're not really concerned about minimum cash tax considerations here either, right?"
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Robert Durian Yeah, I might add, Julien. So right now, what we're seeing is the minimum threshold for the book income to qualify for the 15% minimum tax would be $1 billion, and right now we're probably in that 6 to going to $700 million over the next few years. So we think we'll be exempt from that, assuming that the provision comes out with the same minimum threshold of a billion."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Andrew Levi , guys. When we want to ask a question, how you guys doing?"
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Andrew Levi Okay, that's good. Hold on, just moving a little bit, [Indiscernible] right now. I like the answers to Julien's questions especially on the financing and taxes you guys obviously, particularly looking back to what's going on in the Company and did not. As far as looking forward, could you are you always kind of your capex plans are somewhat spread in loaded in the new kind of fill in. As you look at second part of the decade, and they get out to 25 and beyond. What's kind of not included yet that you envisioned to whether it's in 24 or 25 and more importantly, placed 6.7 to be kind of added or big CaPex, then, going forward."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"Robert Durian This is Robert, I guess, when we look beyond 25, which we've announced today, we have provided some guidance through some of our materials that show we're thinking about roughly seven to $9 billion of CapEx over the following 5-year plan. And if you think about that, I think it's going to be a continuation of what we're focused on now. A lot of it is going to be focused on cleaner energy sources. Think of that as more solar, more wind including repowering opportunities, more storage. So all those lines up well with what our intention, ours too. To translate or transfer our generation fleet to cleaner sources. And I think this new legislation that's being proposed under the budget reconciliation bill we'll be very supportive of that and help be able to provide some good cost benefits for our customers through that program. And also on a continuation of our electric grid spend. So we’ve obviously talked a lot to you guys about the fact that we feel it's very important to focus on reliability and resiliency in that system. And so we'll see a continuation of undergrounding. Spend on 25-gig standardization. So that's going to drive a lot of that CapEx the latter half. So those are the two primary categories, will have other things that will obviously watch, and as John indicated before, we let our capital compete. We're always looking for the best opportunities for our customers. But those seem to be bubbling up to the top right now as far as cleaner sources of energy and the grid."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Andrew Levi Okay that's . And then just on the transmission side, again, you know, I think it's smaller opportunity for you, but then I was thinking kind of quickie their customers and all the other money that you're spending and at the same time saving by which we feel have kind of given paid. But one area that's kind of we've always been something that you guys have focused on is like lowering the cost of transmission for your customers. I think I can see the big part of that cost. Could you maybe talk about what efforts, if any, you're trying to do as far as to reduce your transmission costs, as far as returns. And what maybe hearing from the packing and what direction they're going as far as adders. And also potential reduction of the base ROE. And whether you're in support of that or you just kind of been on looking."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"John Larsen Maybe just start with yes. Certainly important Andrew, from overall cost and we know it's important for transmission. That's needed to connect renewables. So we certainly have a forecast for that and certainly would like to see transmission commensurate with their renewable ads. We do continue to focus on making sure those investments remain affordable for our customers. So you will see us weighing in on occasion on those to handicap what's going to come out with the [Indiscernible] I guess I'd say it's going to be just going to assume that it's going to be reasonable, it's going to continue to be helpful for transmission to get built. And other than trying to predict numbers, I think we've got a lot of that baked into our forecast and we'll continue to monitor."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,Q,"Andrew Levi , guys, see you in a couple days."
4466016,Alliant Energy Corporation,LNT,11/5/2021,CEO John Larsen on Q3 Results - Earnings Transcript Call,A,"John Larsen Yeah, you bet, Andrew. . This concludes Alliant Energy. --quarter's earnings call. A replay will be available through November 12th, 2021 at 888-203-1112 for U.S. and Canada, or 719-457-0820 for international.

4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Kim . . I'm here with [Indiscernible]. There's a lot going on in medical office today, including HTA announcing its strategic review this morning. I was wondering if you can comment on your interest level in participating in a potential sale process versus other opportunities that you're seeing in the market."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Thomas John, we're focused on our core business in acquiring new investments and investment-grade quality medical office buildings and financing developments of those facilities. Again, we see every opportunity that's publicly available and evaluate those, but we don't comment some on them to be reached completely. So ."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Kim Last quarter you mentioned John cap rates for high-quality portfolios going in the low 5, and I'm wondering if you can update us on this quarter and what you're seeing fully for those assets."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Thomas Yeah. Like we've seen, we think the Landmark portfolio is -- humbly is the highest quality portfolio we've seen and execute on that in an off-market basis. We are seeing portfolios trade frankly , well below in the mid-fours now today, so again, high-quality assets and kind of sizable portfolios. But we think the Landmark portfolio we acquired at an attractive price and frankly better than an openly marketed process."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Kim Yeah, I was going to asked about that. So the 4-9 was negotiated a while ago. Where would that trade today if it were to be sold? And can you also comment on the refers you mentioned you weren't that concerned about it, but how many assets or what percentage of the portfolio have that option?"
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Thomas Yes. So these were all built, purpose developed for those health systems. I think one was acquired by like Mark in the process of their relationship with the health system. But all of them have a Roper's and where they are on the ground leases. We, our Landmark, or both have visited with all the health systems and starting to receive waivers back verbally and in writing. So they still have some time left in their review process, but we expect substantially all of them, if not all of them to waive those?Ropers? and complete the acquisitions. In your other question, again we're seeing prints of assets sold in the open market portfolio. So on the open market in the mid-4. Again, we think the Landmark portfolio with specifically with the quality of the billing, the age of the billings, the walls of the billings to the health system credits involved, 74% of these buildings are leased to investment-grade health system credit. So, we think we will trade in the mid-4's, but not low 4's."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jordan Sadler . So, I think the previous guidance was for $400 to $600 million. So I guess that's over with, you guys are blowing through that, any goalposts you would offer up for the remainder of the year or just on a look forward basis, John, or just kind of trying to frame up what the investment opportunity looks like. It really [Indiscernible] after the third quarter."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Thomas Depending on how you count, there's a lot out there available in the market and we're still evaluating some opportunities before the year-end. And I don't think we're prepared to update guidance, if you will, as we didn't blow through the 4 to 600. And included in that is we've got -- we did announce over a billion of investments which is the biggest challenge is of Landmark, of course. We do have 3 projects still under construction, one of those will break ground in the first week of December. It's a 100%-leased, beautiful facility and we think it'll be an award winner next year and in the Minneapolis market, got 1 in New York MSA under construction with Landmark, and we now have an option to acquire that building when it's completed next year and then we have projects within investment-grade tenant in the Dallas, Fort Worth market. I think we will see a little bit more completed this year and then first-quarter pipeline is really building up nicely."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jordan Sadler Okay. And then can you speak to sort of the financing evolve this maybe Jeff, you can kind of frame up where you are on leverage right now on a pro - forma basis for all this activity and sort of where you expect to be or how you expect to get back this where the target range."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Theiler We only have 4% to 6% of our leases expiring each year over the next 3 years. And we've prepaid pretty much all of our debt. So, we only have $84 million of debt to refinance through 2025. So we think we're in an incredibly stable financial position, so we'll leverage trend down from 6 times pro - forma, yeah, it probably will. Are we nervous about carrying 6 times debt to EBITDA for some period of time? No, absolutely not. So we will be opportunistic as we look at funding, it will depend a lot on the upcoming pipeline and we'll just kind of continue to evaluate it."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jordan Sadler Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just coming back to Landmark, but also the HonorHealth transactions, including one of the more recent ones, new construction assets at closing in. What looks like a 4.5 cap. Can you maybe speak to the merit of investing in MOB sub-5 -- at sub-5 cap rates, and maybe it would help by explaining the difference in the growth profile of the -- maybe the HonorHealth assets versus the actor's portfolio for example. Where you're getting a 5.5."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Theiler Yes. I understood Jordan, you know, the Phoenix market is really as hot as it can be, pardon the pun with Phoenix. We think the rents at that -- in those two buildings are below market at this point, and certainly in the current market. We have some shorter-term leases in those a nice long Walt overall in both those buildings, but we have some shorter-term leases where we can move some things around and take advantage of some of those kind of mark-to-market and that billings. We think the kind of opportunity set there, in particular, as, as much stronger than that stated first-year cap rate. We have opportunities from reward development and more acquisitions with HonorHealth itself directly and so these were off-market transactions. They were under construction, kin d of went into a pre -sale arrangement with them mid-year and it took them to allow the uncompleted, and [Indiscernible] and rent commencing. So the rationale for that I think -- I think Jeff can walk through the math and then kind of with the ramp bumps. And again, our expectation of moving some rent start more aggressively in parts of those buildings. There will be a creative in 2022."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jason Coniensky Hey, , guys. It sounds like you have an opportunity to potentially drive rent growth higher. You've been holding back from?space?. I was wondering if you could quantify that opportunity."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mark Theine Yes. Sure. Jason, this is Mark, As you mentioned, and we said in our prepared remarks, we deliberately did not renew a few leases this quarter to make room for our anchor tenants, in many cases, investment-grade rated hospital systems to expand and take over the full building. That's a specific example in Louisville that we have just seen. And then year-over-year, some of the other spots, we're really -- we're really picking our spots and focused on markets like Phoenix, Orlando, Dallas, where market rental rates are increasing more than the averages. So for us, our portfolio is 96% leased, but there's opportunity as you know from maybe 1%, 2% of the portfolio here to really pick our spots and trend drive, rental increases and market rents higher than normal."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jason Coniensky Okay. And then as we look into the acquisition pipeline, looking ahead to 2022, obviously 2021 is very back-end weighted. Should we expect anything similar in 2022, given you're still going to be digesting the landmark deal or will it be more evenly spread out throughout the year?"
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Hill Hey, , guys. One of the things that we've noticed and certainly in our channel checks is there's a lot more interest from private equity and medical office. And I'm wondering you think about that. How do you how do you think about those competitive pressures? How do you drive accretive growth? Do you -- would you consider levering up here a little bit given your Balance Sheet? Just sort of thinking about a pretty, pretty strong background -- backdrop for medical office and how you handle allocations drive through that?"
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Thomas If you look at institutional real estate investors, whether they be public or private, look across all commercial real estate asset classes. I don't think there's another one maybe, but cell towers that collected virtually all their rents in 2020 and many are still suffering through significant declines in occupancy and high wage labor costs, which don't affect us. And so as you're allocating capital in an institutional investor, it's no surprise that some of the world's biggest private equity firms and non-traded rates are going to be very attracted to the medical office space and I'm just driving appreciation of assets, again, in a 4 or 5 a day kind of FMV of best-in-class assets. Generally a 4-pack cap rate going in, but we look at our investments on a long-term IRR basis. And so again, those investors that have a 3 to 5-year ho rizon, with a be private equity or other private capital. We think we compete very well against that. We think the health systems are looking for long-term owners with the transparency about public Company and opening the business model of a public Company that's wants to be -- create situations and relationships that are win-win and that's -- we think that's how we keep getting repeat business with the likes of HonorHealth and others and had a  long-term relation with Landmark and they finally decided just to sell us all their assets and so we think that's the updating the firm to welcome to the party. We have  relationships with most of them and look from time-to-time with potential joint venture opportunities. But for the most part think, adding assets to our balance sheet is our primary focus. Jeff."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Hill That's helpful guys. If I may -- i appreciate the collar on the unlevered yields for Landmark. But any thoughts or anything you might be willing to share on accretion in 2022 or 2023? I recognize it's early. Recognize you haven't guided. So, if the answer is no, I completely get it, but I figured I'd ask."
4466017,Physicians Realty Trust,DOC,11/5/2021,CEO John Thomas on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Thomas Yeah, the answer is generally no, but the Landmark portfolio does have some more vacancy across the portfolio than our our portfolio and we're already working on in evaluating lease-up opportunities for that space and we were talking about two or 300 basis points, but there are some shorter Walton in some of those buildings and as we talked about before, the market rent are moving more aggressively up in those markets and so again, we expect to take full advantage of those opportunities with those health systems and source new developments with those health systems. Got it. , guys. . Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, there are no further questions. I will. . Turn the floor back to management for closing comments. We appreciate everybody joining us this morning. We look forward to follow-up calls and Nareit. Unfortunately, Zoom is next week, but we look forward to seeing you one way or the other.  for participating. . Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference.  for your participation.

I guess with the Delta wave and the labor pressures have you seen an uptick in the number of investment opportunities, particularly in Senior Housing? I mean, should we continue to see that activity from year-end persist over the next several months in quarters?"
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nick Joseph . I appreciate all the comments on expenses, and rate and occupancy, but just as you step back and think about kind of margin, once we get through some of these transitory issues, how do you think margin long-term for Senior Housing will compare versus pre -COVID levels? , Justin."
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rich Anderson Hey, . I have a question about vaccine mandates, and at the property level, and how that's being managed. And I'm curious -- I don't know if I remember what that number is for Ventas, and if you could share that, I'm sure at some place I'm just not remembering it right now. But who makes the call on that? I assume in a SHOP 's execution that Ventas has at least a say in that, maybe I'm wrong. And I'm just curious what your thesis is or your ideas around vaccine mandates at the property level now and perhaps taking into account the Pfizer news and what you're thinking about it going forward. ."
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nick Yulico . . So I was hoping you could -- I don't think you break out labor expenses and the change there. If you could just give us a feel for how much they did increase quarter-over-quarter, and year-over-year, and just how we should think about the trend of labor expenses next year, because I know there's some optimism that you think that it's going to get a little bit better, but I'm still just not entirely clear why use of contract labor and other items would go down in this type of job market?"
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Hill Hey,  guys. And  for having me on the call. It's good to be a first-time caller, long-term listener. I did want to talk through and maybe hear a little bit more about your operator contracts. One of your peers have talked about maybe half of them renewing in 1Q, and the other half rateably throughout the year. I'm wondering if you see something similar and maybe you can unpack that for us"
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Derik Johnston Hi everyone. . Can we go into some detail on the SHOP transitions to the more experienced local operators in various markets, but really specifically, how that may have impacted these transitions, the 4Q guide. But at the same time, how the transitions could benefit first Q in 2022. ."
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Juan Sanabria Hi, . Just a question for Justin on asset management. You seem to be making a transition to more smaller regional operators, which makes sense. But just curious on a couple fronts on the data analytics front, what you guys are doing and maybe some hires you've made there in the efforts that are being put forth? And then secondly, just as we look forward, should we expect more dispositions heading into '22, given some of the stuff that was on the market didn't transact, and you haven't necessarily sold a ton of assets, and the leverage is still a bit high. So just curious on go-forward dispositions, thinking about '22 and any clean up that thing you guys want to do for the portfolio as we exit COVID."
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Eric Glenn Hi, this is Eric Glenn on for Steve. I guess, as the labor pressure eventually starts to subside, how do you think this affects long-term productivity? I know one of your peers had mentioned, that it would take several quarters to reach the same level of historical productivity, Due to the time that it takes to re-amp new staff up to speed, and deal with onboarding. I was just curious if this is affecting you at all or is the actual staff turnover not really high enough to have an impact here? ."
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jordan Sadler Hi, there. I just wanted to circle back on the ESL transition assets and maybe I think in the press release last month, you talked about no contribution of NOI in the second quarter. I'm curious what the progression was sequentially? I know we haven't same-store numbers, but I'm curious what the ESL portfolio did sequentially? And then I'm curious what the outlook would be because I would think that an operators transitions historically have caused some disruption. So it's was what sort of the outlook would be in terms of looking at the curve of a recovery in the cash flow to go for that portfolio when we should expect that to start to, at least bottom and then start to recover. ."
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Mueller Hi. I'm wondering, how much of the higher labor expense pace do you think is attributable to recent rate pressures for existing staff that maybe be a little bit more sticky versus the idea of just having to utilize more higher-cost contract labor?"
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joshua Dennerlein Sorry guys. I was on mute there. I was looking at the rep for growth for the same-store pool, just kind of curious if you have any kind of expectations as we go forward when it might turn to positive growth on a year-over-year basis?"
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Carroll Yeah. And I know that existing Senior's Housing residents generally don't like to move away from the communities that they are in. There has been a small percentage that didn't like to do that pre [Indiscernible]. Has that trend come back post - COVID, or residents still hesitate to move in because of the pandemic, or move out, sorry?"
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Debra A. Cafaro Could you repeat that Mike? And welcome back.

4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Carroll Yes. I know residents generally don't like to move out from their facilities on the seniors housing residence, but there was a small percentage pre -COVID that was willing to do that. Has that trend come back at all or are residents still hesitant to move out because of the pandemic?"
4466020,"Ventas, Inc.",VTR,11/5/2021,CEO Debra A. Cafaro on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Debra A. Cafaro Operator, did you have [Indiscernible] questions? At this time, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks? I do. As I said, we have a lot of optimism and confidence. It just happens to be a momentous day with the advent of additional COVID treatments and a real line-of-sight to this pandemic possibly being over. Our business is doing really well. It is diversified and benefiting from the internal and external growth. Avenues that we have. We have a  set of partners and a  team here at Ventas. We're very appreciative as always of your interest and your support in our Company. And we look forward to seeing you soon . This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Cheng . . 2 questions, please. First, you have the authorization for the buyback, but quite frankly, I don't recall EOG ever done any buyback for the past 20 years. So can you talk about what is the condition or criteria to -- for you to actually act on it? And in theory, if you're going to buy it when the market is suffering the downturn, does that mean that you should have a really strong bond in circling into the downturn maybe at a net cash position, so -- in order for you to be able to afford it. My last [Indiscernible] saying that at the top the pandemic, your share pie as really attractive, but I'm not sure that you have the [Indiscernible] or that the will to do the buybacks at that point. That's the first question. The second question is on the hedging, you have been quite aggressive, putting in a lot of natural gas hedges. Curious that with your low break-even requirement and very strong Balance Sheet, why put on hedges so aggressively onto some degree even though you have a physical barrel of [Indiscernible] that to support you. But is that the fundamental basic you said you could become a speculation on the direction of the commodity prices. When you're doing it that way? ."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arun Jayaram . Ezra, the 2021 cash return to equity holders as tally just under 30% of CFO, if you add in debt, it's around 36% of your CFO. I know there's no formal framework in place, but how should investors be thinking about cash returns on a go-forward basis and could this 30% be viewed at some sort of the benchmark?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ezra Yacob Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. No, I wanted to -- I would not take that as any type of benchmark. I think we've been very clear for the last couple of years in talking about our framework for cash return, really just our free cash flow priorities. The emphasis -- the priority really is on a sustainable growing regular dividend. We think that's the hallmark. It's forward-looking and that's the hallmark of a very strong Company. Hopefully, it sends a signal to everybody the -- of our confidence in the growing capital efficiency of our Company. Obviously, we've talked about some low cost property bolt-on acquisitions. We've highlighted those on the last call and in the slide deck today. we've obviously covered a very strong, not just strong, but really a pristine Balance Sheet. And then to the last part of -- really the other part of your question is our other cash returns options for excess-free cash flow, which is the special dividend, and then as Tim was just mentioning, some of the share repurchases. And as we've said, we're very committed to returning excess-free cash flow. We have stayed away from a specific formula because, we'd like to be able to -- we try not to run the Company on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We tried to take a longer view of things. We realized that there are times when potentially the cash on hand may need to move up or down. But regardless of it over the long term, I think we've demonstrated, especially this year, that we're very committed to returning that excess free cash flow."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Arun Jayaram . And my follow-up, with the dividend increase to $3 on an annualized basis, as well that will represent just over $1.75 billion in annu al outlays to equity holders for the dividend, how should investors be thinking about future growth? Does this temper how we should think about longer-term production growth given the higher mix of dividend payments?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeanine Wai Hi,  everyone.  for taking our questions. Our first question is on the special dividend. In terms of the timing and the process for that, when you looked at the potential to announce one, what did you see this time around that perhaps you didn't see last quarter when you decided to forego a special dividend?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tim Driggers Jeanine, this is Tim, so as already been stated, we are committed to our free cash flow parties and that has not changed. So we look at all the factors every quarter to determine when is the right time to do either special dividend, or nail the share buybacks, or increase the regular dividend. So when we looked at our cash balance at September 30, was sitting at $4.3 billion. That gives us -- that leaves us well-positioned to pay off our bond in 2023 and provide this $2 special dividend. So it's a combination of all those factors and we felt this was a meaningful amount of cash to return at this time."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeanine Wai Okay, . And then my second question, maybe following up on Arun 's question on the base dividend. The large increase in the base, it seems like it's a catch-up to close the gap between what the business can support given the premium and double premium wells like you just said, and what was actually getting paid out. So I guess in terms of the timing also on the base, we're just curious how much of a factor the potential that you now see in your exploration plays factored into the decision to increase the base."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Gruber Yes. . In your deck, you mentioned a carbon capture pilot project, which is interesting. Ezra, can you speak to your early ambitions in carbon capture? Are you looking strictly at the [Indiscernible] are you investigating pure storage? And what level of resources having committed internally to the initiative?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ken Boedeker Yes, Scott. We're continuing to make good progress on that initial carbon capture project that we've talked about. We've finalized many of the below-ground geologic studies and we're currently working on the engineering and regulatory portions of the project. As we work our way through these steps, we'll get more clarity on timing. But right now we hope to initiate CO2 injection in late 2022. In terms of capital that we're allocating towards it, it's roughly 2% to 3% of our budget is going to be allocated towards all of our ESG projects, is what we see."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Gruber Ken, and as you investigate the opportunity, how are you thinking about participating in the value chain, would you be interested in entering transports? Obviously, it's an exciting opportunity, but it gets more capital intensive where you kind of broaden participation. Just how are you thinking about the broader opportunity in participating across the value chain?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Leo Mariani Hey, guys. Just looking at the guidance here for fourth quarter, we can certainly see some pretty significant growth on U.S. gas. Obviously, looking at gas prices right now, we're at multi-year highs at this point in time. Should we see that as a bit of a signal that EOG is perhaps flexing up a little bit on the natural gas side to try to capture what it probably some fantastic returns at the current prices here."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Billy Helms Yes, Leo. This is Billy Helms. So on the capex side, certainly part of our program as we laid out earlier this year, was just advanced some of Dorado prospect in South Texas, as you know, it's a very competitive gas play with rest of the place in the U.S. And we've been very pleased with the results here. But we may -- we remain disciplined to only completes the 15 wells we targeted and laid out at the start of this year. It's really a little bit early to be talking about what we're going to look like next year. But obviously with the results we're seeing, we're very pleased with the results being -- meeting or exceeding the top curves we have laid out, that certainly gives us an option to look at increasing activity there. It's a little bit early yet to be saying what we're going to do next year, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Leo Mariani Okay. That's helpful. And obviously in your prepared comments, you still spoke about the fact that probably be challenging to meet all the necessary conditions at year-end '21 that you all have laid out to put any type of real oil growth back in the market at this point in time. But I guess we -- I've certainly heard some rumblings lately that perhaps we might already be in pre -pandemic demand levels here as we work our way into November. I think OPEC+ has a plan to reduce its spare capacity pretty dramatically by mid '22. Just wanted to get a sense if you think perhaps in the mid to second half part of '22, there's a good shot at hitting the conditions that EOG laid out to potentially put a little growth back in the market."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Charles Meade Morning, Ezra, to you and the whole EOG team there. You actually anticipated a large part of my question with your answer to the last one. But maybe just to dial in on it a little more closely, how far out do you think your view holds or your ability to look at the balance or unbalance in the oil market? And then once you did see a call to increase your oil activity, how long would it be before we actually saw it in the public markets in your quarterly financials?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Billy Helms Yeah, Charles. For as far as how long it would take before we would see any response basically showing up in our financials. If you just simply look at, when we see the signal and the time we deploy rigs and get the wells completed, non-production takes usually 3 to 4 months. So you'd start seeing it no earlier than that, but probably sometime a quarter or 2 after. So to have a meaningful difference in financial performance."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Charles Meade Got it. So, if I'm understanding you correctly, it's -- it would be 2 quarters, maybe you start to see it nearly 3 quarters before there was a real Delta."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Charles Meade . And then just one quick follow-up for Tim. And I think you partly address this in your earlier comments. In the past, I recall you guys have talked about a target of $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. With this new $5 billion share authorization in a slightly different posture about wanting to have some dry powder, does that mean that your target for $2 billion in cash, and I recognize you're not always going to be at the target, but does that mean that the target has gone north of that? And if so, has it gone to 3 or 4 or what's your thinking?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neal Dingmann , all. I don't want to belabor this just on the growth and reinvestment. But Ezra just want to make sure I'm clear on this, you guys have been quite clear about returns. I just want to make sure that I'm certain around the priority about the moderating reinvestment rate in order to drive the cash returns. Is that what I'm hearing over growth?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ezra Yacob Yes, Neil. When we think about moving forward, we've done a lot on reinvesting in building this Company to take a bit of a step away from the commodity price cycles by focusing in on the premium wells and now double premium strategy. The growth for us has always been an output of our ability to reinvest at high rates of return, through 2017 to 2019 during a period of rapid growth for the industry. In fact, we're reinvesting only at a rate of about 78% and still generating free cash flow every year, and putting that towards an aggressively growing base dividend. So the strategy for us hasn't really changed. I think we've talked about potentially watching the macro environment a little bit more to help formulate our plans year-to-year. And that's where it falls in line with what we've been discussing over the last couple of questions. We still remain very committed to that. We don't want to push barrels into a market that's oversupplied or doesn't need the barrels. And so we'll be looking for the right time to see if the market needs our barrels before contemplating any return to growth."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neal Dingmann Very good, very clear. And then follow up on -- that earlier about you. It looks like you all had been added a little bit of gas hedges. Is that in relation to -- does that mean that you're you've been increasing the focus on the Dorado play given what natural gas prices are doing, so I guess I'm just wondering, is that are the 2 correlated or are you adding to that activity in the Dorado?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Hanold Yes. . I'm going to try, Ezra, I know you'll probably give me the answer that you'll talk about the budget next year. But if I could talk about a more big picture, if we all think of just a base maintenance spending levels into 2022. Would -- has the capital changed too much from what you all did this year? Like what would be the puts and takes from that? Because it seems like your well-cost, you're going hold pretty steadily. So is your maintenance capex case this year somewhat similar to what it would be next year all else being equal or are there anything else to consider?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ezra Yacob Yeah, Scott. This is Ezra and we'll talk about next year's budget, next year. So that a little bit facetiously for you, but quite frankly, I think we haven't updated our maintenance capital number yet. We'll provide that number commensurate with our plans laid out next year. But I think what you can see is that our team continues to make  progress and sustainab le well cost reductions through their efficiency gains on applying innovation and technology. And I think Billy highlighted pretty well that we feel very confident that we achieved our first initial goal, I should say 5% well cost reduction and were in line to reduce our cost 7% this year. And we feel that a lot of those costs are what's going to insulate us against some of the inflationary pressures out there."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Scott Hanold And how about just on -- was there anything unusual you'd say this year that we should think about next year in terms of exploration play or ESG spending? Is that -- is there any reason for us to think about that any differently?
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate , everybody. Ezra, I think your share price reaction today, I think, you can see the market's response to be er cash returns. I'm wondering, why is it reluctant, seemingly still from EOG to provide a framework around the proportion of cash returns. It seems to be a persistent body or perhaps the recognition of sustainable free cash flow, which at the end of the day is what defines the value. I'm just wondering why there is reluctance not to commit to at least lay out framework as to how you think about the go-forward cash returns as opposed to one of those special dividend?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ezra Yacob Yes. Doug, It's a question that we've been answering and we feel that we have provided a framework for our free cash flow priorities. It's as you mentioned, the sustainable growing base dividend to strengthen the Balance Sheet, these low-cost property acquisitions, and then more on point with your question, the other cash returns options which are special dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. And in a lot of ways, when we look back, I think we've shown our commitment to that. Not only this yea r with committing to $2.7 billion return in dividends over a year-to-date free cash flow generation of about 3.5 billion. But I think we added a slide into the deck that shows longer-term what we've been able to do in providing just over $5 billion of free cash flow returns since 2016 on about $10.9 billion of free cash flow were generated. And so I think we've laid out a framework, I think our 2 announcements this year on special dividends totaling $3 per share on the specials, really demonstrates our commitment to it and as far as having the ability for our investors to see through and capitalize on that number. I think we've demonstrated our commitment to the point where the investors can capitalize on some of our excess free cash flow. To us, we still remain committed to delivering on those free cash flow priorities. We do want to continue to make decisions based on what we think will create the most significant long-term shareholder value. And that means sometimes not necessarily running the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but really taking a longer-term approach. And so locking ourselves into a formula that might have to change as conditions change, is really at the heart of our reluctance to do that."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Doug Leggate I understand that. I guess, it's a moving piece. Maybe my follow-up is related then. I want to talk specifically about the buybacks. There's been a lot of reference to the '16, '19 period. And you know the history; it was a subsidized environment. You doubled production. Saudi was taking oil off the market, and we will see how that ended. We know what the response to the industry has been, but I want to get specifically to your view of mid-cycle and how you think then about the relative priorities around mid-cycle. What is your definition of mid-cycle? And how should we think about growth versus growth per share, given the buyback commencement?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Bob Brackett . It looks like you turned a couple of pads on in Dorado in the third quarter. Any color or commentary there; hitting expectations, exceeding?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ken Boedeker Yeah. Bob, this is Ken. As Billy said earlier, we have turned on several wells in the last few months and the color is all of them are at or above our type curve and what our plans were, going into the year. We do have one-drilling rig act even in the play right now and we're really moving rapidly up the learning curve. Again, just to reiterate, this play has really double premium returns and it's competitive for capital with our oil plays."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neil Mehta , Tim. Ezra, every new CEO has an opportunity to put their own thumbprint on the business and recognize that you're part of the prior leadership team as well, but just talk about your early observations as th e new leader of the organization. Any subtle changes that you're making and talking about your messages to your internal and external stakeholders that you want the market to be aware of?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ezra Yacob Yes, Neil, appreciate the question and the opportunity. I think the bigger thing for our investors, our employees, everyone who is listening to the call is that EOG has got a proven track record. Our strategy works the shift to premium strategy has put us on a different trajectory and the shift to double premium is going to as well. The culture of EOG, the people that EOG has always been our competitive advantage, and that will continue to be that way. Honestly, Neil, the most important thing we can do as a leadership team, is put our employees in a position to succeed, where they can really contribute to the best of their abilities. And that's where we try to do every day and that's going to translate into not only our operational performance, that would you see the results of this quarter, but to our financial performance as well."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Neil Mehta , Ezra and the follow-up is I appreciated the slide that shows the breakdown of the well costs in how you guys are ahead of your competition in terms of managing and medicating some of these inflationary pressures. As you step back and think about the U.S. oil industry broadly, do you think this is ultimately going to be a challenge, these inflationary pressures, to restart the shale machine? And which of these bottlenecks or do you worry about the most in terms of being a constraint on the ability for the industry to grow again?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Scialla Hi. . It's a high level question. Ezra, on your long-term outlook, as you think about the energy transition, how are you thinking about oil versus natural gas? Is there any preference there in or any of the exploration plays focused on gas or they all on oil?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ezra Yacob Yes. , Michael. Long term, we believe the hydrocarbons are going to have a -- be a significant part of the energy solution long term. Obviously, we need to do as an industry a better job with our emissions profile. But when you think about oil and natural gas, they both go to different markets dominantly, your natural gas essentially is more on your power side and potentially in direct competition with things such as coal and your renewables. And then your oil transportation. Your oil obviously is a little more focused on transportation. In general when I think longer-term, I think the energy transition is going to be significantly slower than often times you hear about. And we're very bullish on the prospects for both. As far as the exploration plays goes as we've said in the past, dominantly the exploration plays are all oil-focused."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Scialla Okay,  for that. Ken, you had said on your CO2 pilot -- excuse me, your CCS pilot. I think you said you plan to inject in late '22, that seems to suggest you would not need a Class six permits. I'm wondering, is it fair to say you're reinjecting CO2 into an EOR project? And when you say it's not really economically competitive with your upstream business, are you planning on capturing 45 tax credits with any of your projects?"
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Sankey Hi, guys. Just very quickly on -- can you talk about your LNG or what downstream natural gas strategy? ."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Billy Helms  for your question. And . We're -- the team is definitely executing. You've seen several of our slides that we've put back, talking a lot about our transportation position is so incredibly valuable. We can move gas from all our different basins, from the Permian Basin, from the Eagle Ford, we talked a lot about Dorado earlier. And then with that and it gets access as you look along the Golf Course and you look at the LNG demand, especially that's growing over time. Obviously, you know, we've got a position there that we started. And just really speaks to being a first mover, especially, when you think about LNG. We went through a whole BD effort, kind of 17 and 18, we got the contracts finalized in 2020. And in 2021, obviously, we're definitely seeing the value of that contract. So being a first-mover is absolutely important. And yes, we're going to continue to look at new opportunities from an LNG standpoint, very well-positioned. Again, it gets back to our transport, our export capacities, and just having that ability to transact, we can definitely be very nimble as we even think about new opportunities."
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Paul Sankey Got it. And then a follow-up on the buybacks. I'm not clear. Are you saying that it's a shelf ability to buybacks shares when you want? Or are you actually going to try and get through this amount in the next 12 months?
4466042,"EOG Resources, Inc.",EOG,11/5/2021,CEO Ezra Yacob on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tim Driggers Hi, Paul. This is Tim. We do not have a timeline on when we plan to buy back the $5 billion. When the opportunity presents itself, we will be in the market. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Yacob for any closing remark. We just want to thank each of you for participating in our call this morning and thank our shareholders for their support. As I highlighted at the start of the call, EOG's competitive advantage is our employees and they deserve all the credit for delivering another outstanding quarter. So  and enjoy the we ekend. The conference has now concluded.  for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bob Blue Yeah , Shar. When we set that 6.5% rate in July of last year, July of 2020, we were confident then. We were asked some about it and we said that there's no obviously one input we were asked a lot about this triennial at the time. There's no one input to setting a growth rate like that. It's a variety of inputs and one of the things that we mentioned at the time was we assume that we're going to have constructive regulatory outcomes and we've had those. We had one in South Carolina, and in North Carolina, and in this Virginia triennial. All of that is supportive of that 6.5% growth rate, so we were confident at the time. We announced it. We remain confident; we think we've executed well on regulatory outcomes. And its most recent triennial settlement as a good example of that. As the capital we'll update, capital on the fourth quarter call as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So the bottom line is, we remain as confident in 6.5% as we did when we announced it."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza Got it. And then just lastly on coastal wind, it's a huge day to dump so I appreciate that incremental color you provided. The $87 LCOE capital costs are higher, so obviously you're seeing some cost pressures despite being below the projections and still within the range, right. I think the initial cost correct me if I'm wrong, was $8 billion. Can you touch on the customer bill impact here as costs are higher just isolating this project and it seems that the input cost pressures are widespread. So how do you think about mitigating factors assuming these cost headwinds have some persistency?"
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bob Blue Yeah, so the costs? You're right, the capital costs number is, that we estimated earlier now that we've done all of the competitive bidding process and moved from conceptual to firm contracts, has gone up [Indiscernible]. But as we mentioned, the production expectation, that capacity factor out of this, has also gone up as we've got more data which means that the customer bill impact is the same. As we said, it'd be in an $80 to $90 per megawatt hour range, and we're squarely within that at $87. So, you can't focus just on the capital input here on a project like this. You also have to focus on how much electricity is it generating, since it's going to be generating more than we had previously assumed. That's what lands that customer impact, right where we've been talking about in the $80 to $90 range."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shar Pourreza Okay, . Terrific. I think that sort of touches us on it. See you in a few days. Bye guys."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Peters First question I have is just on the recent election outcomes in Virginia. Obviously a lot of focus there nationally and given that you now have a Republican Governor and I think the General Assembly flipped too, wondering if you could maybe just provide some perspective on what you think may or may not change going forward, particularly with respect to energy policy in the state?"
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bob Blue Yeah. , David. In the last, if you look back over the last 15 years or so in Virginia, I think that party, and power, and the Governor's mansion has changed twice. In the Virginia House of Delegates it's changed twice. In the State Senate it's changed several times. The Senate wasn't up for election this time, it was the governor and House of Delegates. What's remained consistent throughout that period is that our Company has maintained constructive relationships with members of both parties, and we don't see any reason that that would change, and the reason is that what has remained also consistent over that period and even before, is a bipartisan commitment to economic growth and jobs and the economy in Virginia. And if you look at what Governor-elect Youngkin ran on not surprisingly given his extensive business background, he ran on a platform of increasing jobs and economic growth, and we obviously support that. We're going to do everything we can to help him achieve the objectives of growing Virginia's economy. We do that by providing reliable electricity, by keeping energy prices affordable. We've done that over the years. That was our reliability and affordability were recognized by the FCC staff in the recent triennial review so we have a track record there. So what I would expect is that Virginia will continue that bipartisan commitment to jobs and economic development As witnessed in the announcement we talked about in our prepared remarks, the Siemens Gamesa offshore wind blade finishing factory, that was the result of bipartisan work. Both parties deserve credit for that kind of job creation in Tidewater Virginia. We would expect that that's going to continue going forward."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Peters . Second question is switching gears a  little bit just on what's being proposed in Washington with this potential reconciliation bill. Wondering Jim, maybe if you could comment on how meaningful something like a direct day option would be for potentially loosening or lessening future equity needs given the many renewable projects that you guys have here at Omnicom."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Chapman Yeah Dave, it's a . A Lot of commentary on that topic so far this earnings season of both [Indiscernible] in some of that, and I agree with certainly one thing that's come up a lot that it's super hard to speculate on moving target pending and draft with legislation so hasn't landed yet. It's funny, a couple quarters ago on this call, we were all speculating as the impacts of the straight up corporate rate increase -- corporate tax rate increase so how things have changed. But a few thoughts, hard to say exactly what's going to be in the final version but it does seem to us that something is going to pass. So we'll see here next month or two, we imagine it will include the Clean Energy tax incentives and the direct pace  future you're talking about. So that kind of thing, an extension of the tax credits under refundable basis, it's pretty clear that's going to be valuable and will benefit probably both our customers and shareholders. We expect incentives are going to reduce the cost of renewables to our customers, could accelerate everything we're doing in our Clean Energy transition, and probably provide some pretty nice cash flow features to fund additional capital investment, seems pretty good, details to come. Now in the same package there is the minimum tax. Not too disturbing for us who are already a cash tax payer. Not everybody is -- but that's going to be based on GAAP earnings. It doesn't start for 23 is the current proposal, so it's still early. How exactly that's going to work. There is a lot of detail to come but even that part we expect as part of this overall package, we think this is all pretty manageable within our existing financial profile and financial trajectory. So we'll get more clarity over time, maybe next quarter we can be talking about facts instead of speculation, but at all -- it's manageable as a package."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Paul Zimbardo [Indiscernible] method of update overall because I want to follow-up on Shar 's offshore then question. How should we think about the earnings potential and of the credit consideration from the $2 billion increase in the estimated cost?
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Chapman Yeah, so let me talk to that. So, as we mentioned a couple of times here, we're going to provide a pretty comprehensive update on our fourth quarter call on all those details. We're going to do a 1-year roll-forward on our capital plan and we'll go through everything that's related to that in detail like we did last year -- early this year. The increase in the capital cost is one part of the LCOE; the increase in the capital costs on offshore wind. So a couple of things; keep in mind, that's spread over 6 years. So when you do a 1-year roll-forward, it's going to include that 2026 year, previous version only went through 25, So that will be included, but keep in mind that there are some other gives and takes, some other moving parts in our plan. For example, we announced in our IRP in September that we were undertaking a postponement for further evaluation of a couple of things, like some CTEs in Virginia and pump storage projects, so that's not in the current version of the near-term plan. A lot of gives and takes, some puts and takes. We're going to go through all that on the fourth quarter call, but for the avoidance of doubt, we expect all those updates are going to be supportive of EPS and dividend growth guidance. But you needed to look at it holistically and not just based on the impact of the offshore wind project alone."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Zimbardo Okay, that's clear, looking forward for that update. And then I know you commented on the pipe and prepare market but you could elaborate a little bit on the confidence in the transaction closing, given some of the uncertainties you mentioned and confirming the counter party could not proactively pay the termination to the exit and gigs?"
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Chapman Yeah, sure. And let me -- let me -- let me answer that a little bit higher level just for further one's benefit if they're not following, maybe as --- as closely. So we mentioned on the last call, very robust participation is auction. We ran and we feel very good about the announcement we made in October to sell that asset to Southwest Gas Holdings, all-cash transaction almost $2 billion and it is on track. We expect that to close this quarter subject only to HSR clearance. So yes, there is -- there's a lot of back and forth right in the press, we get that but we don't see any impact in our transaction. Our agreement is intentional, on both sides it's airtight. Surplus gas has fully committed financing, is not dependent on the completing equity issuance or anything like that. There are no conditions other than HSR and there is no provision where they could be terminated early. So we feel really good about that. Pretty straightforward, so we look forward to closing later this quarter."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Paul Zimbardo Okay. . Very clear. Looking forward to EEI.
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet Just want to follow up with offshore wind a little bit more here, if I could. Just want to see, how do you see customer bill impacts through the completion of this initial offshore wind phase? And just thinking, what would  be the bill impact under the 80 LCOE scenario? I think you might have touched on there with tax credits."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bob Blue Yeah. Obviously that would improve the customer bill impact associated with how the project is -- as you correctly identify, if there's a tax benefit that gets passed on to customers we're still sorting through that. But again, based on the inputs that we've defined here, we're just staying right in that 80 to $90 range. So we get the lower-end better for customers and obviously we will have to see how that plays out."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Jeremy Tonet Got it.  to that. And then just understanding there's a cross focus with the offshore wind here. Could you outline how the economic benefits in supplier agreements you outline have evolved since this project was first announced?
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bob Blue Yeah, I think that they've evolved to be pretty consistent with what we expected when the project was first announced. So we had a pretty good idea of what will be involved in terms of construction and construction on onshore for the electric transmission, there may be some additional benefits probably with onshore electrical because that's going to be given what we had to do to route this and to make sure we're connecting to the 500 kV. That's part of what's driving the overall capital costs being er. So a bigger investment there, more job creation there, but I think the bottom line is this is going to be good for the Hampton Roads economy, good for the Virginia economy. And I think that Siemens Games announcement is really important because it starts the process here in Virginia, a state that is very well-positioned given its location on the East Coast, given its port and the access to the port unobstructed by bridges and the deep water port to be a real hub of offshore wind economic activity. We certainly support that, and we supported that in working with Siemens Gamesa to put that blade factory here. So, the more, the better."
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet Got it. Maybe just one last quick one if I could? Could you speak a bit more to the R&D in hydrogen pilots, how they progressed over the past quarter?"
4466043,"Dominion Energy, Inc.",D,11/5/2021,CEO Bob Blue on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Diane Leopoldo Hi, , Jeremy. This is Diane Leopoldo. I'll take that one. So, R&D at our program I think is far beyond up pilot now, and we're up and running. We have 1 project that's already in service. So, obviously, starting very small, but we have 5 projects that are under construction now, 2 of which should be entering service in the next couple of months and 4 more that are expected to be under construction by year-end. This is across both our swine and our dairy projects. All projects are doing well. On time, on budget, and we're expecting to keep up that rough pace next year. So that's on the R&D side. On hydrogen that certainly is at the pilot phase. Our Utah pilot, which was at a training facility in Salt Lake City, is just about complete. And the test focused on residential end-use appliances, leak survey equipment, nitrous oxide emissions. The results of those tests confirm that 5% hydrogen blend would not adversely affect the distribution system. All appliance are operated safely there weren't a lot of changes to [Indiscernible]. So we're still doing -- it increased hydrogen blend up to -- from that testing but -- our next steps, several isolated and started the initial design planned test. And we'll be meeting with them over the coming months so that we can launch an expanded pilot probably in early 2023. And then -- project in North Carolina subject to commission."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rich Hill Hey, , guys. First of all, congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to start off with leasing spreads, maybe get some insights from you guys if this is what a normalized market feels like. I typically look at leasing spreads as leading indicator for same-store revenue and same-store NOI. So, I'm curious, does this feel like a normal environment to you post COVID?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Conor Flynn Some pretty significant pricing power on escalating rents in the Sunbelt. I think that's where you're going to see the spreads continue to be quite strong as we're seeing r eally the market rent growth there outpaced the rest of the country.
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Rich Hill Yeah, that's helpful. And the reason I'm just focusing on it is, I go back to your 2020 to 2025 guide. If you can put up these leasing spreads, that might mean that's a conservative guide, but well taken. Conor, maybe this is for you. I noted that Albertsons is worth $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Have you given any thought to monetization, how you would use that in capital allocations? Any thoughts there?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Conor Flynn Yeah. As we noted in the remarks, we have a lot of optionality. I think that's the beauty of where we sit today, Rich. If you look at the business and where we sit, we've got obviously a lot of leasing momentum. Clearly, we're going to allocate a lot of capital to that. That's our first priority as that really fuels the earnings growth. Then we have redevelopment opportunity as well. You've seen the entitlement work we've done throughout the portfolio. And the nice part is we're seeing a lot of external growth opportunities as well as Ross outlined. We do have some debt reduction opportunities as Glenn outlined in his script. We're going to look at the menu and see what's really the most accretive towards our FFO growth because that's really where we're focused and we have a lot of different levers to pull, so it's a nice bucket of capital to redeploy. It's not earning a tremendous amount right now, so we're going to be prudent with it and recognize that we have a ,  many to select from."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alexander Goldfarb Hey, .  out there. Two questions. First, just going to the -- I know you guys are going to return to the Kimco 's name, but the sub-five CapEx that you guys bought at. 1. Just a little bit more beyond what is underlying that sub-five. 2. Just bigger picture, not surprised to see CapEx compressing, but how do you guys -- how was your underwriting of acquisitions, whether portfolio or individual assets changed? Because obviously the price that you paid for Weingarten can't be replicated today. So just curious how you're underwriting deals today, given where pricing is going?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Yeah, sure. Happy to address that, Alex. As it relates to the venture with Blackstone, these are clearly 6 assets that we felt very strongly about. Between the location, Publix being one of the best grocery anchors that you can possibly have with exceptional sales. As I mentioned, the script, having near-term mark-to-market opportunities in Publix anchored centers is somewhat rare. So, when you look at the vintage of those assets, it gives us an opportunity to create some additional growth probably sooner than some other opportunities that we have in the portfolio with Publix. So, we're really excited about that. We're really excited about re-engaging our venture with Blackstone after a very successful one several years ago. Underwriting is still a very specific exercise. If you look at every single asset, every single space taken into consideration the growth in the market's demographics, where the population growth is coming from, and just making sure that we have very strong conviction in our ability to push rents. We're not looking to invest in assets that don't have out-sized growth. So, the ones that you do see us pulling the trigger on, you can rest assure that we believed very strongly that we're going to be able to push that out-sized growth beyond the average of our portfolio. So, I don't think that there's anything specifically changing in terms of our underwriting strategy, whether it's a single asset or portfolio. It's really just making sure that we look at every single asset, every single space, and feel pretty good that there is below market leases that we can push over time."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alexander Goldfarb So, as far as the Blackstone, the sub stock, what would you say that cap rate will get to in a few years out when you have an ability to roll rents?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Yeah, it's hard to predict. We have opportunities to discuss things sooner than later, hopefully with the grocery anchors. So, the timing is going to depend on where those negotiations go. But, like I said, we're very confident that the growth there is going to outpace the average of our portfolio, hopefully by a wide margin."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alexander Goldfarb Okay. And then the second is, as far as retailer demand for space, are you sensing -- not those retailers ever want to pay more in rent. Are you sensing that that rent conversation is easier today? So, when you're saying, \""Hey, look, we have multiple tenants for a certain space. You guys have to pay more. \"" Now, the tenants are more willing to engage in those conversations, whereas maybe a few years ago, they were more willing to push back? Do you sense a change there in the leasing dynamic in the rent discussion?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Greg Mcginniss Hey, . So, thinking about the synergies, which I guess I was pleasantly surprised to you guys, expectation at the top end of those synergies. But given the fairly quick achievement of those goals, is there any potential for additional cost savings through 2022 perhaps?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Conor Flynn Sure. Yeah. There's demand across almost all categories right now. Grocery is the obvious one. They're the clear beneficiary of the pandemic. They now have the surplus cash that they're looking to reinvest in their four walls. Expand our open-to-buy, grab market share and really investors future, so how did they create better connected to the customers. So that's going to be really important for them as well as all sectors. Off-price, as I mentioned earlier at CJ about bras, Burlington, and others, Old Navy, they're all actively expanding their footprint. Again, they see, I think all retailers see this opportunity, where it's a short window to upgrade the quality of their portfolio. Maybe penetrate a market or expand their market share in certain areas that pre -pandemic there was no inventory available. And so, you do have this COVID inventory that's creating this unique opportunity for them. But what I found was actually interesting. This last quarter when we go back to our small shop activity, is that 35% of our new deal activity was related to restaurants, and the fast casual side on the small shop side. So, it's nice to see the fast casual and QSRs are coming back; the crumble cookies of the world, etc. So, you're starting to see that expand out. And I think as COVID anxiety starts to subside, people want to go back and reengage. They want to socialize for social creatures. That's creating that opportunity on the food service side. Fitness, that the value-oriented fitness, Planet Fitness. I mentioned early on several quarters ago that planning crunch. And I'm  very proactive and wanting to expand their footprint and recapture. You're also seeing that now extend out into the boutique fitness categories. So that's again, attracting the small shops. So, you are really seeing it from a variety of areas and then people are playing with formats. With [Indiscernible] who's experimenting with the smaller format right now. So, it's giving them optionality, appreciating that they may be able to provide different service offerings to different customers and different areas. And so, it's important that they have a power to lakefront."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Greg Mcginniss . And this all seems like sustainable demand in your view? Like if you look at the forward pipeline still just as strong as it has been?
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Conor Flynn We're more convinced than ever that last mile retail is where we want to be and where we want to continue to focus strategy. If you look back five years ago, that's exactly where we're focused. And so, we feel like we're in a really good spot to benefit from that increased demand."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Goldsmith  and  a lot for taking my question. My questions on the lease side. We thought you've been seeing the occupancy spread. Given that, there is a myriad of supply chain and labor issues. And maybe a slowdown from lease signing to rent commencement. Like, how should this, how should this metric kind of progress from here, given that the time to go from lease signing to rent commencement is expanding. And at the same time leasing has been so strong. How did those dynamics impact you -- impact the progression from here?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Conor Flynn I would just have the one big benefit that Kimco has is our scale and our efficiencies of scale. So, we were not buying small amounts of HVAC units or roofing materials or anything that's needed for a fit-out for a specific tenant. We usually buy in bulk and we usually get premier pricing as well as relationship pricing. So, we feel like we have the ability to, as Dave mentioned, to utilize our network and to utilize our efficiencies as best we can to try and mitigate supply chain issues."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Michael Goldsmith I'm trying to understand the revenue synergy. I'm trying to understand like if there are revenue synergies associated with the transaction. .
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Sure. Well, on the retailer side, I mean, prior to the transaction, we're typically the largest landlord for a lot of these retail partners. So that's just compounded as a result of the merger. That conversation obviously always has its benefits. They can pull both ways, dependent on what's being discussed. But in general, it does afford us the opportunity to be out in front of those retail partners. They have a very aggressive opening buy strategy. We now have over 560 sites that we can show them to help accommodate and still fill that void. Obviously, you can do that at scale. That's a good thing for both parties. But also helps us progress the conversation beyond that. Retailers are trying to figure out and inno vate and change to become and stay more relevant to the customer. We want to work with them to be part of that solution and understand from a landlord perspective, what do we need to do? So, it creates a very, very constructive dialogue to help drive our business forward and to your point, revenue and top-line growth."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Haendel St. Juste So, The recent JV, the transaction with Blackstone, I found very interesting, a case study of capitalizing on the market moves in cap rates. And then you bought the 2 JV assets out in California, further spotlighting the embedded acquisition opportunities. So, I guess my question is, what's your interest level in pursuing further deals like this? And can you discuss the funding sources if that would involve Albertsons stock at all? ."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Sure, happy to address that. So, for us, we really view it as a significant level of optionality. We've said, even as we've been skinning down our joint venture exposure over the last 7 or 8 years, on the Kimco side, we've had 3 very strong long -term partners that we continue to do business with. And as we've said from the start that we like having the ability to potentially grow opportunistically if there is the reason to bring in a new partner, like you felt here on this particular transaction. But for those that are potentially looking for a monetization event, we are willing and able to be able to have that discussion with them, hopefully in a negotiated basis, if not having that right of first refusal to be ready to take advantage of that if the partners looking to exit. So, one of the nice benefits that we see in the Weingarten merger is after getting down to really just three major partners on a Kimco side, there are now about 14 new joint venture partners from that transaction, some of which are looking to do long-term business with Kimco and we welcome that. Others that are potentially looking to take some chips off the table or monetize their retail investments, and we're also prepared to have those discussions as well. And we are having those conversations as we speak. So, for us, given all the levers that we have, Conor mentioned and Glenn both mentioned in their prepared remarks. Between the significant amount of cash availability on our credit facility, ultimately, Albertsons monetization opportunity, we'll just be very prudent and selective with where we want to utilize that capital, but having a lot of different ways to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Haendel St. Juste . Appreciate the thoughts. One follow-up on the side but not least ABR, I think you mentioned $44.8 million. How much of that should we expect to hit in 2022? ."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Right now, we're tracking around $25 million to about $30 million potentially that could flow in '22. And that would be obviously back-loaded."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Craig Schmidt . . I want to talk bigger about the current operating environment, which seems to have real strength from the consumer. And then, just the aggressive leasing from retailers. This looks like an environment that's much better than 2019 when you go back to look at people's earnings results. So, beyond revenge spending and then, retailers looking to take advantage of opportunities, what's beneath this impressive growth that's happening in the operating environment?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Yeah, I think again, it's -- on the retailer demand, it's a lot of the points that I mentioned earlier, Craig, but it's appreciating that the value of brick-and-mortar is real. The operators see it in their margins, consumer s see the convenience and the efficiencies, the last mile distribution. It goes into this very complex network of how to distribute goods from the retailer to the customer. And so, I think COVID -- the irony of COVID was it sort of validated that open-air was really essential. It's closest to the customer. I think you also now have this hybrid work environment. We don't really know what that will look like long term, but I think the one thing that's clear is going to be a little bit different for everyone. And as a result of that, you are having people that are staying more in that first-ring suburban markets that are maybe starting to appreciate the value proposition there too, which also then creates an opportunity to engage in open-air out in the first-ring suburbs where the majority of all of our portfolio resides. We're seeing that benefit as well, and that could probably carry longer term into the market. So, I think you're just starting to see all these pieces that were in flux and in development over multiple years come to a head and now creating  this environment that we're in today. So going forward, I think you'll continue to see the open-to-buys be aggressive as we start to absorb that COVID inventory. And then, from there, I think the consumer s in a very strong position right now to take advantage of that."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Craig Schmidt  . And then, just on your net debt to EBITDA, I guess it's at 7 or pro forma 63. Glenn, what's your long-term target for net debt to EBITDA?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Yeah. I mean, again, we want to try and keep it in that 6 to 6.5 times range on a total look through basis. So, we're on a proforma basis. We're right in that sweet spot right now. And again, we continue to focus on just bringing leverage down over time. I think as you continue to see EBITDA grow, again, we're being very cautious about how much debt comes on. We've been doing a lot to reduce debt levels, absolute debt levels over time. Again, the Weingarten merger added $8 billion in total, doing $7 billion on a face value, $8 billion on a fair market value adjustment. But again, on an absolute basis, you'll continue to see us reduce debt and we continue to try and reduce as much secured debt as we can as well. So, we did assume about 300 million of mortgages. But over time, we'll just continue to pay those off with unsecured debt or cash flows from the Company."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Katy McConnell . , everyone. Now that you have another quarter of leasing underway, can you update us on your expectations for a March market upside within the  near-term explorations within Europe portfolio, especially on the anchor side? And now you're expecting some upcoming longer [Indiscernible]."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Sure Katie. We're in the process of going through our '22 budgets now. So, when you look at our '22 rollover schedule and for anchor is it is below market and it's below our anchor baggage trends as well, so we do see a nice mark-to-market opportunities. As we either start to renew those leases, avoids where we're well underway there and or sign new leases. So, we do see a net benefit as we go into 22, but we're in the process of finalizing our budgets right now and we'll have a better perspective in the net call."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Katy McConnell . And then on the retailer side, how do you expect the supply chain disruptions in labor shortages to play out through your tenants around the holidays this year. and are you concerned about any potential rent collection fallout, or impact to a new leasing momentum?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Conor Flynn The only thing I would add is, our traffic levels are at 105% of 2019 levels, and we see that in this environment where there is supply chain disruption, we're watching closely as what we think may occur is people will probably buy at the store more often than buying something online and potentially having to wait where it might not arrive in time. So that's the dynamic we're watching closely that we think might play out."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Caitlin Burrows Hi, , everyone. Given the issued $77 million of equity in the quarter and your share price is now above the highs of 2019. Can you just go through the thinking on issuing equity in the quarter and going forward and does it suggest you could equity fund the acquisitions going forward?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Yeah. If we are, as I mentioned, we ended the quarter with over -- we have a $480 million on the balance sheet. We have some obviously activity nevertheless mentioned subsequent to quarter-end. So, it's still sitting with $330 million of cash, no real near-term debt maturities, and full access to our revolver. In addition, we have the Albertsons investment. So, we're in very, very strong liquidity position to deal with things that are upcoming."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin Kim So just going back to that demand question. Obviously, things are . I'm just curious about where you're seeing the hottest pockets of demand, and conversely where it's a little bit weaker. And I know you mentioned Sunbelt versus not, but maybe you can go little bit deeper. Does it matter like what type of center, Power Center, grocery incurred? Is that just location demographic phase where you're seeing more customers or more population growth? Am just trying to understand just a little more granularity on where demand is."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin Kim I don't mean today. I mean, over the next couple of years."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Yeah, I think the next couple of years could be somewhat reflected today as well. So, just thinking of geographic first, could you mention that the Sunbelt, out of the 141 leases that we signed this quarter, over 52% came from Sunbelt markets. And then within that the substantial majority were actually coastal Sunbelt. So, I think you will continue to see that trend progress over the next couple of years. That is where population growth is continuing to rise er than the rest of the country. Second to that though, on the coastal markets, for that remaining, say 48% of leases signed, it was heavily weighted towards the coastal markets. I think you still see that high demand there. So, between the coastal Sunbelt, that's where we have seen the majority of activity. Beyond that too, like Southern California, as I mentioned earlier, is extremely aggressive. It's a very, very tight market to penetrate. So, this COVID inventory created opportunities, multiple demand factors that helped push rents further north. In the north east, it's typically been a fairly mature portfolio, usually having higher occupancy levels. And so, it's just their natural constraints there to actually add any new supply as well, and people wanting to penetrate Long Island, for example. I think it will continue to be difficult. So, when there is that opportunity, do you see multiple bidders at the table wanting to enter the market? And then I think that's what you continue to see play out over the next couple of years."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin Kim And thinking about the Weingarten portfolio, how has that performed relative to your own portfolio. And I guess looking forward, how much more accretive can Weingarten contribution be to the overall enterprise?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Conor Flynn The other part of it is the 3 mixed-use projects that they have they're now, the concessions are rolling off, so the mark-to-market on those renewals is pretty far strong on those three projects. And then when we look at the future entitlement opportunities within that portfolio, that gets us really excited. Because that's obviously where we've been focusing a lot of our time and effort for future value creation. And we feel like there's going to be some incremental opportunities embedded throughout their portfolio. Specifically, Miami, Houston, and Silicon Valley that we're digging our teeth into right now."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen It's a . We thought long and hard about the best approach here. We have a huge, tremendous amount of respect for Blackstone. We've continued conversations with them since the success of our early venture. Ultimately, we felt that it was a perfect opportunity for us to reengage the venture that we had with them. We think that there could be some future opportunities here and this could be the beginning. There's no guarantees one way or the other. But we thought this was a  jumping point given all the activities that we have in the market, all the things that we see. to engage that adventure and see where it takes us. So, that's really what the conversation was and we're excited about it."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Wes Golladay Got it. And then when we look at Albertsons, how should we think about the monetization of that asset, maybe on a, I guess a max dollar per year, if you wanted to maximize your retained cash flow and not payout a special dividend?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen It's a . I think there's a few components that we have to look at when it comes to Albertsons because of the significant increase in its value. Keep in mind our basis is incredibly low, our basis today is still a little over a $100 million. So, the real governing factor for us is real compliance. So, if you think about the real rules, 75% of your gross revenues have to come from real estate related items. So that leaves about -- you have 5% net income bucket and then, you have the other  20% that could be interest in dividends and capital gains. So, the governor is going to be, how much our gross revenues are? And our gross revenues today, on a look-forward basis with the merger, somewhere around $1.8 billion. So, monetization-wise, about somewhere around $350 million to $400 million a year of gain is what we could absorbed today. The larger the gross revenue number is, the more we could do. But I would say today that we're looking at somewhere around $400 million on an annual basis is what we can do."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tammi Fique . Just maybe Ross, thinking about -- you said earlier, I guess that you would think about selling some assets going forward, but given your strong capital proposition, I'm wondering what we can expect in terms of that sales activity in 2022 and if that will be driven by geography or will it be more one-off based upon asset growth profile?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ross Cooper Yeah, I think we believe that our dispositions program will continue to be just a pruning of select assets for a variety of reasons. I did mention how there are several joint venture partners that we have that might be looking to exit. So, we have conversations with them every day. Many of the assets of which we're talking to them about potentially buying out their position, depending on where that pricing is or the quality of those assets. Some of them defer. We may be market sellers if we think the pricing is too aggressive or the asset just doesn't necessarily fit the growth profile for the portfolio. So, you may see a little bit more activity from the joint venture portfolio both on buyouts and some potential spike dispositions. Otherwise, part of what we inherited with the Weingarten portfolio as well as from the previous Kimco portfolio, is some undeveloped land parcels that we're constantly evaluating as to whether we believe they're prudent to be developed over time, or if we are better off recycling that capital, selling from non-income producing assets, and then taking that capital for higher growth opportunities. So that's really where you're going to see the bulk of the disposition activity. But again, we don't think it's going to be a tremendous component of our capital set."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tammi Fique Okay, . . And then maybe one for Glenn. It looks like FFO per share is $0.99 year-to-date, I guess with the guidance raise, it implies $0.37 to $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter. Is there anything in that fourth quarter implied FFO that is non-recurring or is that a pretty good run rate as we think about 2022? ."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Well, again, the $0.37, $0.38 level, again, that is a recurring rate. As I mentioned, the third quarter did have some call it one-time in nature items. You had some real benefit coming from the improvement in credit loss, and we did have about a penny coming from just higher lease termination fees and some of the contributions from the joint ventures on a one-time basis. But $0.37, $0.38 is really a recurring number that we would expect in the fourth quarter."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Samir Khanal , guys. Just in terms of occupancy, when I look at that number, you're already at over 94%. We've talked about how strong leasing is. Can you provide some color on how you think occupancy could trend maybe into the end of the year and how much pick up you could see next year? I mean, you're at sort of your high watermark level as you call it, sort of the 96.5%, so trying to figure out how much upside there is next year."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Conor Flynn Just to clarify, that 15 basis point gain in occupancy, that's a sequential average."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Samir Khanal Right. And then, in terms of shop leasing, I know we've talked a lot about it in the call today, but is this a scenario where you could even go beyond 90%, which is sort of the high-water mark in prior periods?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Has to go off, has to go off. Push it every day, push as aggressively as we can. And then, hoping with the higher-quality portfolio and all the efforts in the investments that we made at site -- on-site is that we have that opportunity to do you so. I think we're well positioned to do it. One thing we haven't mentioned is the pandemic really shined a light on the quality of the landlord. And the landlord and its ability to make critical investments for the health and support. And in some cases, the survivability of the tenant when we launched that TAP program back in April of 2020. It was a real lifeline to help a lot of these  operators that we're just str uggling through something that was completely outside of their control. And that helped us really secure and retain a number of tenants, and you start to see that now with our retention levels. Achievement is of historic highs on our end as well. So, I think when you mix-in all of these components, we have the right ingredients, and now it's incumbent upon us to execute."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unidentified Analyst First question, you saw a pretty good sequential growth in small shop occupancy this quarter. I was wondering how much of that was due to the inclusion of Weingarten in your portfolio compared to last quarter?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Sure. Yes, we mentioned is 180 basis point gain, 120 of those basis points were related to Weingarten and 60 was related to Kimco."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Unidentified Analyst Got it. And, in terms of thinking about your development, redevelopment pipeline, I guess, when should we expect to see some projects from the Weingarten portfolio be added in there."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Sure. I think it's important to look at our redevelopment pipeline in 2 separate but complementary categories. The first is our core retail and repositioning effort. So, the repositioning and remerchandising of the anchor boxes, building a better mouse trap for the existing retailers, that's where you're going to continue to see a lot of investment, and we're just in the process of integrating those opportunities and those projects into the combined Kimco portfolio, so that should start to be reflected in the coming quarters. And then the second part of that is obviously our signature program. The one project we did activate earlier on was The Milton, the second tower at the Pentagon, where we had recently completed the Whitmer, and that's a 250 residential unit project. And when we look at those projects going forward, we have a real menu of options. We have over 4,000 in total residential units that we can draw upon now. Our goal is to obviously expand the entitled and the built population to over 10,000 -- 10,000 to 12,000 in the next five years. So, we'll look at those selectively and determine at what point in time it makes sense to activate them. And at what structure. And the structure will then -- it influences in factor and how much capital we actually have to deploy out in the market."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Powell Hi, . Just a question on the demand related to last mile. Given warehouses are sold out nationally, it seems like it could be a pretty powerful driver of demand. Could you quantify how much leasing demand you're seeing related to retailers and meeting more distribution in their local areas?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Conor Flynn Yeah. And just anecdotally, the last I would say, 5 to 10 years, we've been dealing with the narrative of shrinking box sizes, downsizing, downsizing, downsizing and now the question is, hey, is there additional adjacent space that we can take to enlarge the box. So, it has changed, I think the narrative on becoming more flexible and how you use the square footage and integrating that last mile distribution inside the box. So, to your point, it's one that we're watching closely."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Powell . Maybe on supply and I know it's not a huge issue now. But given the strong fundamentals, I would imagine that some people will start to try to build extra supply. What do you think will change the dynamics of low supply growth in your markets? At what point does it become more of an issue?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Conor Flynn The costs are a big issue. So, if you think of the land values where we're located. So, if you look at our portfolio of map, that's the main reason why we transformed our portfolio to where it sits today. It's because we wanted to be in locations that have high barriers to entry. So, when the supply cycle does come back, it's very hard to make it pencil to go and buy land and develop a shopping center that would compete with one of Kimco's. You've got to look at the obviously the FAR as well in terms of the build versus the parking lot. And that's again another barrier to entry of these dense areas. You just don't have the luxury of putting 80 % of your property as parking lot and not generating any revenues from that. And so, we're watching it closely. We do think there's a good amount of slack still to be absorbed from the pandemic, and we're experiencing that throughout our portfolio. But to your point, if rents get to a point where they justify new development, it should start to happen. We haven't seen it yet. But those barriers to entry is why we've positioned our portfolio where it is because we don't want to be sitting in an asset that has tremendous amount of unbuilt dirt around it where you can have a competitor come quickly, reap our positioning, and so that's why we've done a lot of work to be in the position we are today."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Lucas , everybody. 2 questions from me. You guys closed the brief deal. There's no mortgage debt on that joint venture. Is there plans to put mortgage debt on that or given the -- where your balance sheet sits and where their balance sheet sits it's just going to stay debt-free at this point."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Yeah. Chris, there actually is a small amount of debt about $170 million on that portfolio, which we assumed in the new joint venture."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Lucas It does mature though soon, doesn't it? And I thought we paid it off, but I know it mature soon."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen Yes, it does. We're having conversations now internally with the partnership, and we'll determine what the next steps are there. The expectation though, is, again, with this partnership, as you've seen in many of our joint ventures that they'll be property level debt on it."
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Lucas Okay. And then Glenn, while I've got you, the portfolio is bigger, it's more diverse. You deleveraged some, got a lot more liquidity and different levers to pull. Is there a goal of getting ratings increase from the rating agencies given that backdrop? Or are you comfortable where you sit right now?"
4466045,Kimco Realty Corporation's,KIM,11/5/2021,CEO Conor Flynn on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Cohen As we've talked about, and again, it is clearly an objective and a goal of ours to get put on positive outlook and eventually get to an A3 A - level. We think it's a separator -- a differentiator for us. And it's something that we think actually should just happen naturally as EBITDA continues to grow, and we continue to just improve overall capital structure. I mean, we really check almost all the boxes for them. Some monetization of Albertsons, I think over time will -- should hopefully steal the deal for them."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nigel Coe . So yes.  to the details on the business performance. It seems that you're outperforming in a few key areas. North America residential will be one. It seems like the applied performance was also better than some of the peers we have seen so far. And performance contracting stands out this 5 quarters now of double-digit growth. So, I'm just wondering if maybe touch on those 3 areas into more depth. And the resi, I think you're still more skewed towards independent distribution, so I'd be curious if you could just maybe breakout the sell-in to sell-out performance there. ."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Oliver Nigel, just for clarification, what was the first comment you made?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nigel Coe Really, it's about -- I mean, if you could just make on the industrial residential performance versus the industry applied high single-digit growth and then firms contracting. It feels like you're outperforming your competitive. I'm just wondering if you could maybe just comment on how you feel your market shares are performing. And then then just on Residential, if you could just comment on sell-in versus sell-out in that channel. ."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti Let me comment on some performance infrastructure, Nigel. This is a proxy for what is happening in the market for sustainability. As we put in our opening remarks, orders for this business for the year was growing at 42% and we are very pleased about how this business is behaving across the globe. We have created a practice now, adjust and control, fully dedicated to sustainability and we're very excited by what we can do for customers on this front, Nigel."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gautam Khanna With -- would love to hear your thoughts on service attach rates this year, and what you think the ultimate entitlement is? 40% goes to 50%, does it go to 60? And if you could just talk through the economics, how that bolsters the margins and the likes. What -- it looks like you're above your plans, so just wondering if we have a new target out there? ."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Oliver Let me start. Service has become core of everything we do, we've got an incredible base of service over $6 billion. We get about 55% of that recurring, and we're making a lot of progress. Certainly not only expanding our market coverage, we've been enhancing our technology and now deploying a lot more digital content within the solutions that we provide to our customers, and we've been going after the underserved install base. Within credible installed base, we have a material opportunity and we believe a competitive advantage now with the technology that we're bringing to really create a lot of value. And it's got a very attractive margin profile as you know, 2 times the Company EBITA margin. And so, that all being said, with the investments we've been making, we've been certainly not only as we bring new projects to the field, we're getting a lot more connectivity and getting attached PSAs, but we've been going after the installed base which historically we had not served. And so, this year, with the work that we did, we got that attach rate up to now 40%. We're continuing to make a lot of progress with that install base. We're committing another 300 to 400 basis point improvement in '22 and that's all tied to when you look at the new services that we're bringing to the market, we're bringing 20 new service products and offerings in '22 across our domains, leveraging technology and data insights, and that will enable our customers to not only reach their clean air, fire and security, as well as sustainability goals. And that's going to be a big focus for us. We believe, as we laid out the guidance that we are on track and being able to outperform the market and be able to outperform by roughly 200 or 300 basis points on a go-forward basis."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gautam Khanna Do you have a sense for the upper limit, though, in terms of what that attach rate could get to? 40 goes to 50 goes to 60? What do you think the upper limit is? ."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Oliver We believe when you look at our technology and our capabilities to truly n ow differentiate, how all of the equipment that's been installed really differentiate in the performance. We have the opportunity to go after all of it. Now that all being said, there's customers that do some of their own self-maintain and the like, but we believe there's going to be an element of service that we can provide to that entire install base. So, we're going to be driving to -- we're attaching on new projects. We are getting a very high attachment. And now going back after the install base with these service offerings which are huge value creators that we have an ability to be able to go after all of that and we expect it to get to 70%, 80% here over the next few years."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti The attach rates on new products is indeed very high and very metro presentative of the quote that George has mentioned, 70%, 80% attach."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Oliver Let me start with the first question there. When you look at what we've done here in the last year, given all of the volatility, I would say that our team is operating a top quartile. That we have been able to navigate and be able to stay ahead of the disruption, we've been working closely with our suppliers, we're working closely with our customers. And ultimately, we've been able to deliver on our commitments. And so, we're going to stay proactive. We're going to continue to work it. With that all being said, we do believe that in the quarter, that there was probably an impact of about 1% to 2% on topline as a result of the shortages that hindered our ability to be able to convert all that we could've. But the team overall has done a  job working with our suppliers to be able to mitigate the impact, and ultimately secure the critical materials. As it relates to labor, because of our growth rates and the like, we have had a program management team globally to make sure that we're positioning ourselves to get all of the critical talent that's going to be required to support the growth strategies that we laid out during the Investor Day, which we feel very good about. And so, we have been able to stay ahead of the curve and being able to bring on whether it be the skilled technicians, the technical capability that we need to support OpenBlue, all of the different capabilities to be able to produce. Now, with some of the demand, we have been -- we've talked a little bit about the -- with accelerated demand in unitary residential and as well as rooftops. We've had -- we've been stretched with capacity. That being said, we have be en bringing on new capacity. We just brought on some additional capacity here in the last month, which will help improve our abilities there. But overall, I feel very good given the volatility and our ability to be able to attract and retain the talent we need and ultimately work with our suppliers and work with our customers and try to mitigate the impact that we're seeing both in orders as well as our ability to fulfill because of shortages."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Josh Pokrzywinski I appreciate that, George. Just quick follow-up for Olivier. Can you spike out what price in costs are individually in '22?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti So, in '22 G -- inflation, we are planning to have is about 3% to 4%. So, for '21 was about 2%, the exit rate in '21 was a bit higher, 2% to 3%. But for the full year of '22, 3% to 4%. To answer to your question on price cost equation, we have now -- we have a  pricing practice at Johnson Controls. I can go into the details if you have another question on this. But we have been in Q4 price-cost positive, including excess logistic cost. In the equation, we have been price-cost positive in the second half, and we're planning to be price-cost positive in '22 as well including in Q1, Josh."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Davis George, do you mind talking a little bit about this Accenture and Alibaba deal. What exactly are you doing for them, what's the scope and can it widen out beyond China, is this some sort of experimental test and if all goes well, you move on or -- I will just leave it that, let you address it."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ge orge Oliver Yes, Scott. We talked a lot about this at our Investor Day. When you look at what we're doing with OpenBlue and the technology and the domain and expertise that we bring to buildings and infrastructure. How do we build out our ecosystem? And when you look at a holistic solution, we have the right technology partners and we have the right go-to-market partners. and so, as we've been doing that. We've been working closely with Accenture relative to their capabilities in how we go to market and ultimately driving a full holistic solution around sustainability. And then working locally with Alibaba and working with Daniel Zhang, relative to getting the technology required to be fully successful within the China market and being able to serve those customers with our full holistic solution. We believe the market opportunity, Scott, is multi-billions. With what we're going after, it ties to our -- it really ties to our ability to drive de -carbonization. And obviously with that, more healthy buildings and ultimately connected buildings that drive different outcomes within the infrastructure that we build. And so, we're very excited with the partnership, and I think as we deploy our holistic solutions, critical partners in being able to execute."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Scott Davis Hope that helpful. The labor availability issue, is that been much of an issue for you on the install side, George? Is that a risk in '22 in increasing or is it decreasing risks?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti An additional point, Scott. Our productivity program now, which is ramping, and which would impact COGS this year, is also based upon increasing the productivity of our field operation, including the productivity of our engineers. So that program is coming also handy at this point in time, and is helping us also to manage those labor availability challenges you have mentioned."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Sprague Morning. First just back to service, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- I guess the phrase I'll use is calorie count, not only is the attachment going up, right? But a clear focus here is to add additional services and the like. I just wonder to what degree that is showing up and what you're putting in your backlog and what that might portend as we look forward another year or 2?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Oliver When you look at -- like I said, this is become a central focus for the entire organization, recognizing that all of the investments we make in products, as well as now with OpenBlue, the translation of that, Jeff, is into a solution into a recurring revenue that ultimately creates more value for our customers. And certainly, we get the return through our service margin rates. And so, when you look -- the traditional service business, obviously that's come back nicely post-pandemic. The accelerator now is what we're doing with digital, the new OpenBlue offerings. That all is helping us to increase attach rates. And then not only attach rates, but now additional services, taking the intelligence, applying AI, and ultimately, now delivering these new service offerings. As I said, through 2021, we delivered 15 new service offerings. A lot of those were tied to [Indiscernible] buildings, sustainability, all of our key growth vectors. And we've been able to build a tremendous pipeline of opportunity that we are now beginning to convert. When you look at Service Orders, we're up 7% above the 2019 levels. And we see that continuing with that momentum, because not only is it we getting the core business is coming back, and we're going to continue to maintain that with the traditional service business that we perform. More important now is the conversion of all of the new services on top of that, that has become the accelerator. And so, we believe that we're positioned here well to continue to build backlog to get more of it recurring, and ultimately, with the value that we create, continued very strong margins on that service going forward."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Sprague And then I will take an Olivier up on his offer to just elaborate a little bit more on price. It does look like on a price cost basis you are doing a bit better than some of your peers. I just wonder if you could unpack a little bit, equipment price versus service price. How you were -- how you got ahead of the curve. And is one side or other of that house service versus equipment really driving the equation? And I'll  leave it there. ."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti Jeff, I'm going to answer to both because really, the model we have today covers both. You mentioned that we have executed very well in terms of price cost. And price cost is actually one of the, of course, foundation of our operating model. Let me mention a few levers we are using today; 1, we have priced project through last year anticipating some level of inflation. That's point number 1. Point number 2, we had modified about 2 years ago our contract agreement to a lowest to adjust pricing. Point number 3, we have identified now. because of our business intelligence, part of the market which are less sensitive to price. For Number 4, and George mentioned that today, our offering now provide  value to our customers. [Indiscernible] sustainability, indoor air quality, and we offer  ROI for our customers and then price to value. Our backlog is now also shorter, so we can adjust pricing faster. On matter use, for large part for our whole matter use today, we have EDGE program covering costs for about 6 months. And last but not least, across the enterprise at Johnson Controls, our workforce incentivize, is incentivized to drive pricing rates. As a result, to all of this, you end up with the results we have been posting, Jeff."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Pat Hey, , everyone. This is Pat on for Steve. Quick question just on your organic growth path for the year. Starting off at mid-single digits in the first quarter and then accelerating to 79% for the year. Can you talk about the levers there? Just trying to understand the visibility of that. Is it supply chain, you know, relief. Is it a ramp in pricing or something else? Just want some color on that. That'll be helpful."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti Right. So, in the growth, we have mentioned high-single digits organic growth. Pricing is about 3% to 4% in that number. If I decompose the growth by vectors, service is expected to grow 6% to 7%. We mentioned why that is at length to some of the questions we had earlier. In term of Install, Install is a very strong business, particularly at the back of high profits. This is a business we expect to see bringing about 6% to 8%. And global products, we expect this business to grow in the low-teens. It's a strong vector growth for Johnson Controls. Our team is doing  work launching new products. The new products we're going to launch next year is accelerating. We mentioned more than 175, we launched about 150 this year. And the last proportion of those products, a large proportion use heat pump as a key technology. So, we believe that today we have many vectors to grow the enterprise. Leveraging also the circular trends impacting this industry, decarbonization, indoor air quality, digitalization of the building space. And we're very excited about what we have in front of us, and also what we are building at Johnson Controls still."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Pat I think -- well, I appreciate the color. I guess what I was really asking is, so first quarter you're guiding up mid-single-digits. The year you're guiding up 7 to 9. What drives the ramp from mid-single-digits in the first quarter specifically to that high single for the year, so you expect growth to ram p through the year?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Oliver And I would say there is still a little bit of pressure that we -- similar to what we saw in fourth quarter relative to our ability to convert, but again, it's minimal."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Pat I understood. And then my follow-up is on the -- there has been a lot going on in the portfolio over the last couple of years, so hard to get a read on normal seasonality, but you mentioned it in the slide. So, you said first quarter is typically 15%. What do you consider to be normal seasonality for second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter? If we get some color on that, that would be helpful in modeling. And I guess we should assume second quarter is above normal, just like first quarter is, given your first half, second half comments?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti It's a very precise question. Typically, the first half as Johnson Control has represented about 30% of the total year, we believe we'll be in the mid-30's in the first half. Considering by the way, the supply chain constraints we are having today or it's factored in that statistic."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julian Mitchell Hi, . Just wanted to touch on --  -- incremental margins and operating leverage. It looks like you're driving in a, maybe a mid-20s rate for the year, closer to 20% incremental for the first quarter. Is the key headwinds for the year just all about price cost? Anything else to call out? And maybe help us understand how you see that 40-bps price cost margin headwind phasing through the yea r?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti So, you're right. The incremental industry [Indiscernible] in the range of mid 20% to 25%. I just sit for price costs, it would be in the 35% range, meaning, we are aligned to what we had communicated to you. Our productivity program is intact, we expect to save other net saving about $230 million this share which would flow to the bottom line. In addition to that, we'll have a 30-basis points improvement in margin. If you look at the phasing, the 40-basis points impact in margin for the year is going to be a bit higher in Q1, slightly higher. And I want to precise again, this is important, price cost positive in dollar [Indiscernible] rate including also extra freight cost, for example, Julian."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julian Mitchell  very much. And then, just secondly. Maybe switching to the revenue line, maybe just fill out in a bit more detail the assumptions for organic growth this year. What's underpinning the sort of Fire & Security assumptions versus Commercial HVAC in terms of applied and unitary. That would be helpful, just what you're dialing that 7% to 9% for those main pieces."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Oliver Julian, I think it's important to note that on the short-cycle, Fire & Security business is coming back very nicely. We saw our products business up 9%. We've got  backlogs there, so that's continuing. The field-based business has been a little bit slower on the recovery because they don't -- we don't have the focus on Clean Air, and all of the work we did with our HVAC and a lot of the focus on short-term on sustainability. But we see some nice trends here, so through the course of the year we'll continue to accelerate. But it'll be short of where we -- what we see commercial HVAC to be for the year."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Deane Dray I just like to follow up on Ju lian 's first question and just make sure I understood Olivier 's answer. On the question and to the clarification on underlying margins, EBITA being 70 to 80% up in fiscal 2022. The cost takeout program, that net of 230, that should contribute 90 basis points, if I've got the math right. Does that imply the underlying margins are worse or is this just an element of conservativeness at the beginning of the year?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti So, you're right, if you factor the impact of the COGS and productivity program is close to a point. You will have to factor also Silent-Aire in the equation, which is dilutive in rate. But we see today, net of the price cost I've mentioned the 40 basis points if you do the math, you end up with a margin expansion higher than 100 basis points, 110 to 120. And as I indicated, our margin profile is improving because of the value of our point and our productivity program is well on track."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Deane Dray Alright, that's really helpful. I'm glad you pointed that out. And then second question. George, can you talk about the outcome or performance-based contract growth assumption for 2022? We've seen this ramp pretty impressively from I think it was 2% in 2020, 15% at 1 point in '21. What's the assumption for '22?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Oliver If we look at this business, we have a lot of conversion coming from what would have been conventional business to now incorporating that business into solution -- differentiated solutions. And so, as we look at, for instance, the partnership we have with Apollo. And this is the focus on de-carbonization and sustainability. We've got a pipeline that we're working that's over $1 billion, in how we're going to convert. And now, some of this depends on the timing of conversion of orders, but we're making tremendous progress right now, working a number of these and working to convert a number of these. So, it's hard to say exactly what's going to ultimately come through performance contracting. And then what we would still gain if it were not to be the full solution, what we would gain in our traditional HVAC businesses. But, Deane, this is going to be, when you look at our vectors of growth, decarbonization and sustainability, healthy buildings, and then ultimately smart buildings. A lot of our go-to-market with the -- we actually deliver an outcome solution, a lot of that will be done long-term with under-performing contracting. We've got a leadership position today with our performance contracting business that ultimately has been focused on energy savings. We've expanded that. And now with our go-to-market we have, I believe, tremendous potential here over the nex t few years to make this much more significant within the portfolio. But I feel really good about it and it's going to continue to grow."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti The pipeline statistics. Deane, the pipeline statistic we mentioned, this part of the pipeline at Johnson Control is the one growing the fastest by a margin."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Noah Kaye . s. Just a capital allocation question. Obviously, you provide a lot of color on the framework on Investor Day. But for 2022, can you first comment on the M&A pipeline strength, whether you're seeing some HVAC consolidation opportunities or other growth opportunities that are interesting? And then excluding a potential M&A, is the default assumption in guidance that substantially all free cash flow is returned to shareholders?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti So, we -- if we look at the free cash flow, we said that in our prepared remarks. We are very convinced that we are 100% plus free cash flow conversion Company. We had a  performance in '21. Because of the strong free cash flow, we're going to do 2 things: 1. Grow [Indiscernible] align with earnings, and 2. Deploy $1.4 billion of buyback in '22. More or less, equally distributed among the 4 quarters. On top of that, we believe, as we have said during Investor Days, we will add 1 to 2 points of revenue growth through M&A. One is staying into our leverage guide of 2 to 2.5. M&A being focused on services, digital, de-carbonization mainly. And the pipeline is growing nicely. We have a new team today leading this particular part at Johnson Controls and we're very pleased with the progress we're making in growing the pipeline."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Noah Kaye Perfect, Olivier. And then just a follow-up on that, with the Silent-Aire acquisition, clearly, you signaled you're able to do more deals of that size. Can you just comment on whether or not that pipeline is accelerating in terms of the flow and inbound inquiries? Should -- that once 2 points that you expect this year have you got it sustainable over a multiyear period?"
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"George Oliver Yes. So, let me take that. Certainly, this was directly aligned -- this acquisition, with our overall capital allocation. M&A strategy is right down the middle. A nice bolt-on. And overall, we're extremely pleased with the progress we're making. This is just a phenomenal opportunity here going forward. The data center market is a $16 billion market. We have 5% share and we have the opportunity to now leverage our entire footprint now to take advantage in a much bigger way of the global market. And so, we see that growth to be very strong going forward. We're continuing to build the pipeline. We're expanding the customer base that we're beginning engagements with, and how we innovate and serve their data center needs going forward. And so, on a go-forward basis, it's going to be one of the significant growth contributors to the Company."
4466062,Johnson Controls International plc,JCI,11/5/2021,CEO George Oliver on Q4 Fiscal 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Olivier Leonetti . At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to George Oliver for closing remarks. Yeah. Let me wrap up the call here today. I want to thank everyone again for joining our call this morning. As we discussed here this morning, we had a very strong finish to the fiscal year. And certainly, the underlying momentum that we're seeing in our businesses is extremely encouraging. As we enter fiscal 2022, I think it's important to note that the growth accelerators are ramping, and are well on our way to achieving our fiscal year '24 targets that we laid out back in September. And we all look forward to continuing our discussions, speaking with many of you soon during the conferences. On that, Operator, that concludes our call.  all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet I just want to touch on the LNG market a bit here, interest and heard about the new prospects in Mexico that you were talking about, but just curious, I guess for your thoughts on the market. Right now, we've seen some others kind of signed some contracts close to 20 years pretty recently here. And so, it seems like the market could be improving. And I understand that there's two types of markets, the spot obviously being very strong right now, but you guys are looking at the long-term contracts and there's some different dynamics that go on there. Just wondering if you could help us think through how the market looks at this point for the longer-term contracts."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Justin Bird , Jeff, and hi, Jeremy. Yeah, I think we've seen a dramatic improvement in the market, both on the spot market, and I think importantly, you're starting to see some of these long-term contracts come back. Also, importantly, we're seeing higher forward curves over the next few years for deliveries into Asia and Europe. And I'd say the final thing that we're seeing that I think is important is you're seeing China 's reentry into the long-term market. We are seeing a real uptick in our discussions, both in Asia and Europe, and frankly, as well as South America. So, I think we're going to see some exciting things coming over LNG portfolio and we should benefit from this constructive market backdrop. Again, we think we have a competitive advantage, the ability to dispatch directly into Europe and Asia. And again, over the long term, it's nice to see that we still see demand for LNG growing mid to high single-digits, which supports our long-term very bullish view on LNG development."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet Got it. That's very helpful there. , and maybe peeping towards California here. And thinking about the California investment opportunities and some of the reliability considerations that remain in focus, are there any near-term opportunities you see for San Diego Gas & Electric at this stage? And just you see smothers in the state in a moving forward and different initiatives. What do you think are next steps for you guys there?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Justin Bird  for that, Jeff. , Jeremy. Yes, we are seeing a lot of opportunities at both utilities. Jeff mentioned at the gas Company obviously, a lot of clean fuels opportunities around RNG and hydrogen. But you specifically asked about SDG&E. At SDG&E we're seeing a big push in the state, given what we've seen in the last couple of tight summers around more storage capacity, more generation capacity. I think SDG&E will have some filings in the next few weeks around more utility-owned battery storage. I think you'll also see a lot more activity in the coming months and years around electric vehicles too. California has made a lot of bold commitments to move -- much more strongly toward electric vehicles. And, I think you'll see a lot of grid enhancements and good modifications in that area. But I'd also remind you that, climate resilience is a big thing here, and so continues to be a lot of wildfire mitigation opportunities to invest capital as well."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeremy Tonet Got it, that's helpful. I'll leave it there, ."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Constantine Lednev , team. It's actually, Constantine here for Shahriar.  for taking our question. Just following up a bit on the LNG market question. As you're putting out a more discrete SIP project pipeline, are there big economics for the projects within that pipeline still in the same low-teens IRR range that you've targeted before for some of the discrete projects? And how do those differ between the 3 categories that you outline?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin So, I think you're talking about the return expectations across all 3 platforms?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin What I would probably say is, in this midstream space, we target mid-double-digit levered type of returns. We think those are consistent across all those. Interestingly, on the Clean Power side, you may recall that we've seen returns come in here in the U.S. That's one of the reasons we exited that business two or three years ago. In Mexico because of our border position and the access we have to two very important transmission lines that bring power into the U.S., we think we have a real competitive advantage in that region. So, we expect relatively higher returns in which, you might find in renewables here in the U.S. So, I would stick to say an overall of Justin 's portfolio, is going to manage toward mid-double-digit equity returns. One other thing I'll mention too to the broader LNG story, Justin and I got back from a recent trip to Europe, where we visited Warsaw, and Dusseldorf, and Berlin, and Brussels, and other places. There's a tremendous amount of recognition in Europe about the role for natural gas and specifically LNG. And there's certainly a new risk premium being assigned to pipeline gas. There's even discussions at the highest level of the EU about creating a strategic natural gas reserve. We've got a team on the ground next week in Asia. I think going back to the original point with Jeremy, there's a tremendous amount of conversations today. And I think this continues to reinforce our bullish case for LNG"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Constantine Lednev Excellent, that's  color. And I guess also shifting to the updates and regulated CapEx. I mean, we're obviously seeing a healthy on core update, and do you anticipate a similar entry year cadence of an update for California? And maybe you could be a little bit more specific, as you're thinking about the opportunities that you outlined, is there any anticipation they are going to realign the focus with policy, both in state and federal, and the next iteration of those filings and GRC I suppose?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin Let me start a little bit more broadly. I think there's been a lot of interest as people have engaged with us over the last couple of months, about having better visibility into Sempra 's long-term growth rate. You've heard us talk about our track record in the past of growing this business. Whether it's a 10-year period or 20-year period, at an EPS growth rate of around 7% or 8%. I must tell you; we feel fairly confident in our ability to produce similar growth in the future, over 7 to 10-year period of time. And part of that, is bolstered by this continued point that we make about the quality of the markets we're participating in, right? So, you've got the number 1 market in America is California. And the number 2 market is Texas. And I think Allen just has a remarkable story in Texas which keeps getting better. And to your point, we're going to have an opportunity to restack our capital program here in California. It's part of our GRC filing next year. And I think you should expect to see us to make filing requests around many of the things that Allen's doing, which is around resiliency, modernization of the grid, and making sure we're mak ing those investments today that ensure that our infrastructure is future ready for what we need in the future, such as hydrogen and other things on the system. So, we have a fairly clear pathway to grow the business in California, very similar to Texas. And I think one of the things you're seeing on today's call is a pretty bullish case by Justin about what we can do in the Sempra Infrastructure business as well."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Constantine Lednev Well, I think that that's an abundance of clarity. , Jeff."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Hey, .  for taking my question. Just -- I wanted to go back to the Analyst Day and you specifically disclosed roughly $2 billion to $3 billion in additional CapEx at the utility. So, would this update -- what portion of that CapEx you've locked in or have included in the plan?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin So, I think, there were a couple of things I have to make sure I don't misunderstand your question. The difference between the 5-year strip from Oncor that we presented in June, which went through 2025, as compared to the new 5-year strip, which goes to 2026 is a difference of $2.8 billion. We also talked about the Analyst Day, the intra-period change in 2021 and 2022 from the prior year's period. So, I think that you've seen two things take place. Year-over-year, you've seen the 2021 and 2022 CapEx for our utilities increase. But since June of this year, you've seen Allen 's numbers increase by $2.8 billion. So hopefully that's helpful."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Yeah, absolutely. But just -- in terms of like the Oncor CapEx itself, I think the number out there was like $775 million to $1.3 billion."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin Yeah, Yes let me address that and hopefully, this will be helpful. So, a couple of points. The 5-year strip, going back to June has increased about $2.8 billion per Allen's organization, and Allen had an incremental bucket separate from that of $775 million to $1.275 billion, and that incremental bucket has been unchanged. And maybe Allen, it would be helpful if this is the right time to maybe do things for our -- 2 things, for our listening audience, Allen, talk a little bit about what's in your $15 billion CapEx plan. And separately, what's not in the plan related to future rulemaking and related to your incremental bucket, which I think is the nature of the question."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Durgesh Chopra Sure Jeff. Yes, . So, I think you described it very well. And what we've done today, is announced another billion dollars of Oncor CapEx over 5 years or $2.8 billion since the Investor Day, like Jeff said. That is really backed up by what Jeff mentioned in his opening remarks. Just tremendous growth that we can talk about across our system in a minute. But that $15 billion over 5 year is our new plan. To just point, a couple of years ago, we introduced this idea that, we had this other bucket, this incremental bucket of potential CapEx. And to just point that incremental bucket which we -- I think announced at $725 million to $1.275 billion."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Durgesh Chopra  both. Appreciate you breaking that down that down for us. .
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd Hi, .  so much for taking my questions. I wanted to talk about federal legislation and in particular, green hydrogen, though there are other elements here that could benefit Sempra. You all have been innovators in a number of areas that could get support at the federal level. And I was just curious at a high level, I know the exact composition of the bill could change and obviously we are not even sure it's going to pass at all, but to the extent that we did see the framework that's been laid out, what are the areas that you're most excited about in terms of what that support might mean in terms of accelerating your plans or changing your plans?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin I appreciate having the opportunity to answer that question. I think back in 2018, you may remember Stephen that, there was a lot of discussion around being in regulated businesses -- unregulated businesses. And I think, we took the opportunity to redefine an investment-class. That said, at the end of the day, these are all energy infrastructure investments. And how you make money may be different in the regulated framework versus outside of the regulated framework. And we really went to ground this idea of being ahead of others in define in the markets where energy infrastructure would grow the most. I think in my opening remarks today, I tried to really emphasize the point that energy infrastructure's quite hot in Europe and Asia, and the U.S. I think there is really well-positioned and the infrastructure bill that you're referring to, is certainly strong confirmation bias of the importance of this to U.S. And there's really a tailwind for Sempra around this clean energy transition. So, 4 topics I think come out today's Bill, could pass as early as today out of the house. One of which is we're tracking the private activity bonds. These are ones that allow you to finance carbon sequestration and carp carbon storage devices. We think that's important for the sector. The IEA says there will not be a net-zero 2050 without carbon sequestration. And that's one of the reason that Justin 's business is focusing on this opportunity. Second to your very point, green hydrogen is a big part of our country's future. We've made a decision to participate in all the appropriate trade associations. We've got something like 10 to 12 different R&D Projects in hydrogen today. But specifically, in the legislation, the bill contemplates 4 regional hydrogen hubs in the country -- we think this will be important -- as you think about distribution centers. And one thing that people sometimes missed even as the number one manufacturing facility in the U.S., by a wide margin, is the LA Basin. And the number 1 industrial segment for the U.S. is the Gulf region between Texas and Louisiana. So, both of these are areas that geographically we have a vested interest in, I think we've got a leadership interest in. So, I think hydrogen in both of those markets will be important. Two other quick points from today's Bill: 1. is the focus on wildfire management, we talk about this Stephen, a lot in California. It's obviously a western region issue, It's an issue today in Europe and Australia and Ukraine and in different parts of the world. But the build does contemplate support for vegetation management and improving resiliency, which is a very important topic here in California. 2. there's a lot of focus in the bill and electric vehicles. Trevor and I participated in the strategy session with Allen's board last week in Texas, the electric vehicle market in Texas is enormous. Today, there's about 30 thousand  vehicles on Oncor system In comparison, we're 120th the size of Oncor System here at SDG&E and they've got 70,000 vehicles on our system. So, I think electric vehicles will be very, very important and the bill is very specific, about funding opportunities all across the country to promote electric vehicles. So, those are the 4, we're probably following most closely. But we do share your optimism around green hydrogen."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd Well, that's a really comprehensive answer.  very much. Helpful to understand the areas you're focused on. Shifting gears just back to LNG, you raised a lot of good points earlier, about the strength of this market. The excitement around this market, and you guys are well-positioned, does that sort of level of excitement globally provide additional opportunities to either monetize some of your assets or to find just very low-cost ways -- low cost of capital ways to pursue additional growth like the additional opportunity Mexico you mentioned. In other words, could this be both the way to monetize as well use other people's money to help achieve better growth and better returns overall?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin Yeah. One of the things I would start with saying is the priority of our capital program is our U.S. utilities. And what we want to do is be able to grow our utilities at a rate faster than our peers and do that without coming back to the capital markets to issue separate equity. And that's one of the reasons that the KKR transaction was so important. It gave us a chance to crystallize and highlight value in that business and recycle capital back into reducing parent debt and meeting to the capital needs like Allen described today but I would tell you, I don't think we're finished, right? That business now has been valued at roughly an enterprise value of $25 billion, so, we think about going forward. We think there will be strategic opportunities to bring that business to the market, but those are conversations we would obviously have with KKR and to your point, if we have the chance to further diversify the capital structure at higher valuations, that's something you should look for us to do. And we will be looking under Faisel and Justin's leadership at bringing in project equity on some of these projects to reduce the call of capital from Sempra Infrastructure. But right now, they are very, very focused on growth, and there's a lot of enthusiasm , of what they think they can accomplish."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Byrd That's .  very much, that's all I had."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Lapides Hey, guys.  for taking my -- morning Jeff,  for taking my questions. 1 short-term, 1 long-term, 1 -- the short-term 1 is, can you remind us what's in guidance, what's assumed in your 2022 guidance in your growth trajectory for what happens in the California cost of capital dock and the mechanism. That's question A. Question B, longer-term, on the potential new Mexico LNG project, can you talk about what kind of pipeline development is needed to get the gas from the Permian to the site. , guys."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Justin Bird Yes. . , Michael. Yes. Vista Pacifico would effectively source gas from the Permian from the U.S. basin and deliver it in the form of LNG to Asia. There are two existing pipelines that basically converged very close to the site, so there would be a very small spur type pipeline that we would build that we connect to PacificO2 existing pipelines, both of which are underutilized on a transmission capacity basis. So, I think very little pipeline construction associated with this. This is part of the strategic location of the project is its proximity to pipelines and the fact that 2 of those pipelines are very underutilized."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Lapides Got it. And just 1 quick follow-up. Are you the only LNG, or potential LNG project competing to utilize those pipes?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Justin Bird Which we own. We own the pipeline, yes."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ryan Levine Hey, Jeff. Given the political uncertainty related to CFP contracts in Mexico, are there any proactive steps the SIP or broader Sempra organization is considering to mitigate the counterparty risks or other broader opportunities to capitalize on the growth in Mexico? And then related, did Sempra have any differentiated impact relative to its SIP partners in any policy change in Mexico in conjunction with the KKR agreement?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin I would start with your second question, which is KKR has their own infrastructure presence in Mexico, both on the refined product side of the value chain, as well as with renewables. They are certainly collaborating with us constructively with CSE, so that's been helpful. I can make a couple of comments to Ryan that because of o ur headquarters be in here in San Diego. You'll recall that we've been investing pretty consistently down in Mexico for close to 25 years. And what excites us back then still excites us today is you've got about a 130 million consumers. It's one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the Western Hemisphere. And most importantly, is the largest synergy export partner for the U.S. at about 7 to 8 BCF per day. And I think even though we've got leading scale and expertise at Sempra Infrastructure, we're still very selective about the projects we expect to invest in. And even the Vista Pacifico project that Justin was describing, those capacity releases on some of these pipelines that, would be needed would come from the government. And this is really a government-sponsored project, and one that they've been quite public about supporting from a permit and pipeline capacity standpoint. But curious you, I think is quite topical that, there are reform being proposed in electricity market. I think you'll expect to see the lower house vote on that, in the fourth quarter. But it would not clear the legislature until probably April of next year, and we handicap that, as a low probability. And what's interesting about this is, those reforms largely target to the point you made Ryan, generation assets that are connected to the CFE system. And today, we have a relatively small footprint in generation across all of Sempra because we're a T&D business. I think the electric investments in Mexico account for roughly 1% of our consolidated earnings, and more importantly, the vast majority of all those projects, something like 80% are on the border with California are not connected to CFE and dispatch directly into the Cal ISO. But I will leave you with one thought which is probably the most important. We made the decision several years ago that what we really want to do is help President Lopez Abra be successful. So, the majority of our conversations are focused on ways that we can partner with his cabinet to make Pemex be successful and make CFEB successful. So, when you see us announce projects like Vista Pacifica is because those will be done largely in tandem with the objectives of the government. That's one of the reasons we still feel good about those types of projects in Mexico."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Zimbardo Hi, , team. I said a question, if you could discuss at a high level, just how you think some of the latest cost estimates change for the Brownfield and Greenfield development projects? However, you want to frame it, what percentage changes, or just how to think about the latest commodity backdrop."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin So, I think there's 2 parts of that question. Number 1 is this issue of, how much inflation are we seeing in terms of, how we source our soft and hard costs at any of our projects, including our utilities. And we've got obviously some building mechanisms that help us with that on the utility side. In Justin's business, you recall that, we were very reliant on EPC wrap contracts, so the procurement and exposure to costs, we shift that risk to the construction contractor. And that's why, it's important that they have strong credit counterparties. But in terms of Brownfield versus Greenfield, I think the way I would answer that, a very general levels to say, Brownfield projects always have a cost advantage, and Greenfield projects can be also quite viable. Typically, they B2B to be done at scale, and Port Arthur would be an example that, but coming back to our projects, think about this. For us to have the opportunity to turnkey 6% to 7 Bcf -- I mean, 6 to 7 MTPA at Cameron expansion, Our view internally as it could be one of the lowest cost projects for new capacity in the world. So, our likelihood of going forward that we account as being relatively high and that's why we've got a 100% of MOUs in place to get to the next step and move to heads agreement from the SPAs there. And then this to Vista Pacifica o, this is the type of price very similar to ecoPhase 1. Our expectation is it will be oversubscribed. That is a greenfield project but the geographic location to be able to have direct pipeline access from 2 different pipelines to Waha and to be able to dispatch directly into the Pacific, will be a tremendous and competitive advantage where we market that project."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paul Zimbardo Okay, now that's . And then shifting back to Oncor,  for that super detailed breakdown. Given the robust opportunity set should we think about October 2022 board meeting as the next opportunity for refresh, or should we think more of the 2021 pattern where those update sprinkle throughout the year?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin It's such a  and I hate to foreshadow that we're going to be sprinkling things throughout the year. But I'll give Allen  credit. It wasn't that they had an ongoing process just to update their plan. They were looking at issues in the market around inflation and how they supply chain issues in advance. So, the real genesis of Allen updating Capex guidance was he came back to the boards so they can make forward purchases that allow them to keep their 2021 and 2022 capital plans in place. What they were doing is they are reaching forward to source what they needed to execute those capital plan. So, I think you would expect his team to do something very similar. Is there watching the marketplace if there's opportunities to adjust that they will. And I think he made a  case for We didn't cannibalize that incremental bucket list. That's been replenished as we look going forward, I think that they will continue to look for opportunities to take price risk away from their capital program, and ensure that they can deliver the plan they have on the street  today."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Craig Shere Hi,  in your time. So, do you see the potential for Topolobampo jumping ahead of Port Arthur, in the new project cue. And did I hear correctly that, the focus will be on securing equity from partners outside of SIP, where needed, If external equity is required for construction of 3 simultaneous accretive LNG product -- projects: ECA Phase 1, Cameron Phase 2, and of course something else."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeff Martin A couple of things here is the Topolobampo project will be very similar in scale to ECA Phase 1, kind of that 3 to 4 million-ton-per-annum size. It definitely can jump ahead of Port Arthur, so that's the answer to your first question. We certainly are quite bullish both on Cameron expansion, which is 6 to 7 MTPA, as well as the Vista Pacific project, which is closer to 4 million tons per annum. In terms of equity, we're very comfortable with the level we're at today with KKR. Certainly, if we saw opportunities to diversify the capital structure at Sempra Infrastructure at points in the future at higher valuations, we would evaluate that against the opportunity to bring in equity down to project level. But definitely there's an interest to attract equity participation at the project level, given the size and scale of our expectations around LNG."
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Craig Shere That's very helpful, and the last question, maybe Justin, if you want to opine, but we've kind of noticed that equity cargo capacity that can be delivered years in advance of new trained construction appears to be a major selling point for new long - term contracting. On track doing, like the latest Venture Global announcement included some short-term supply off their [Indiscernible] house. How do you see this market dynamic playing out with respect to SIPs portfolio?"
4466170,Sempra,SRE,11/5/2021,CEO Jeff Martin on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Justin Bird Yes. It's a  point, Craig and I think you even saw Cheniere's deal today, had a lead into the bigger capacity coming at the long term. So, I would say, I wish I had capacity I could sell right now to bridge some of the construction on these other projects. Because I do think it is a competitive advantage. The market is very hot right now, and people are looking for volumes in the next few years. I think for us, it's a question of maintaining our financial discipline, potentially looking for partners where we can provide some bridge volumes into volumes coming from our facilities. And then looking for potential excess volumes that could be available via the partners out of Cameron or when ECA Phase 1 comes online looking for some additional volumes as production actually starts and we see what production looks like. Yes, I think you raise a  point having volumes to bridge into these long-term contracts, I would say is a competitive advantage and it's something that we're focused on and looking for opportunities to find those types of bridging arrangements."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Goldsmith .  a lot for taking my question. Your third quarter benefited from the strengthening of the core business in conjunction with collecting some of the past rent. So presumably and as your guidance suggests, recovery of prior reserves is going to decrease in the future. And as that why it's down, can you talk about the -- you're going to be passing from collection of pass-through to continued growth of the core business. So can you talk about the trajectory of those two businesses and whether that means an FFO acceleration in the future?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer And Michael, I like how you ask the questions, so I'll -- and with all of those, there's a lot of numbers and a lot of facts there and a lot of moving pieces. What I want to make sure doesn't get lost is the really vast improvement and the demand for leasing and for space in our properties because we did lose occupancy. And what is going to drive the acceleration is going to be our continued ability to release that space. And that's really important and we're seeing that demand come through."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Goldsmith Incredibly helpful. And just as a follow-up in your guidance, the expected cap rate for dispositions fell from 5.5% to 6% last quarter to 5.5% this period. In addition, your acquisition cap rates decreased from 5.5 to 5.1. Is it fair to say that industry cap rates have compressed 40 to 50 basis points since last quarter? And how does that make you change -- or how does that make you think about doing acquisitions, dispositions, development, and redevelopment going forward? Does that 'change your view?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer I don't believe that the cap rates are necessarily compressed by 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Our guidance as a result of the mix. So we did announce the acquisition of Blakeney which is an exceptional asset. And that -- obviously the negotiation of that was even prior to last quarter so the cap rates were already there. With the Blakeney acquisition, we are also, if you will, match funding that with very low cap rate dispositions, non-strategic in the fourth quarter and that's what drove that the increased guidance for dispositions with that lower cap rate for that. So it's a mix of properties on both the acquisition side and the disposition side specific to Regency. Cap rates have compressed all year long and as I said quarter-over-quarter, I don't think that there's been much of a change, but there's no question that for the type of property that we already own and therefore are looking to add into our portfolio, it's going to be in the 5 -- 4.5 to 5 cap rate range. That's high-quality grocery anchored shopping center pricing today. It does not change how we think about acquiring and how we think about adding, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Portfolio enhancement has always been a really important part of our strategy, and we do believe that continuing to grow with premier high-quality assets like we already on will help fortify our future NOI growth as we dispose of those that perhaps may have a lower growth profile than our average, or may be non-strategic."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Michael Goldsmith  again and good luck in the fourth quarter.
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Katy McConnell . , everyone. So I'm the Carolina deal, can you provide some more background on how the deal was sourced and what you're underwriting for upside opportunity to the property. And then lastly, just wondering how dispositions [Indiscernible] your funding plans for the beyond fourth quarter?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Mas Hey, Katy, just following up and clean that up from a funding standpoint. You're right. And this is a little bit to Michael's question as well. When you think about recycling, you typically think about dilution. And we're not -- we're familiar with that. We had some dilutive recycling in our history. We're in a unique period of time. Where we're adding to our disposition pipeline is actually low cap, low -- at the same time, low growth, non-strategic assets. And if you click through and just look at our dispositions on a year, you see Pleasanton Plaza, you see Hancock Sears Pad, non-income producing assets. Obviously, this is an ability to put that capital back to work. You see Gateway 101, it's basically two boxes, very low cap, very low growth, if any, it's flat as a board. And then we were recently able to sell the Parnassus Height Medical Center. Again, highly sought-after asset class, not consistent with Regency strategy, low cap rate. We're adding a couple more to the dispo guidance and what that blend of capital provides us is actually an opportunity to invest that accretively into a property like Blakeney, with on -- which has a headline and on the surface looks to be quite an aggressive cap rate and it is. But Regency at this unique period of time was able to make sense of that economically."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Bilerman Just as a follow-up, it's Michael Bilerman, . Lisa, you've used institutional capital for a very, very long time. I can remember sitting down with you almost 25 years ago when you were running a fund platform with Bruce. Can you talk a little bit about where institutional capital is in partnering with you for further acquisitions, I see you looking at a lot of stuff right now, or whether you'd want to do it wholly-owned. And conversely, whether you would sell more into JV or institutional capital. Maybe just talk a little bit about the appetite, just given your deep history and relationships with that capital."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer Of course. , Michael. And I think I do remember that meeting 25 years ago. We have spoken with many investors about this over the past few years, especially in light of some of the buy-in of the USAA and some other dispositions. And back 25 years ago, we really utilized third-party capital as -- we've always said, there's 3 reasons, access to capital, access to opportunities and access to expertise. And 3 years ago, it was a combination of access to capital and access to opportunities. We were much smaller Company then. Today as we think about it, I just said, I believe that if we don't have the best, we certainly are really darn close to the best of the team in the business. So we don't necessarily need to access to expertise and the capital markets can be a little volatile. We haven't had the need for access to capital. We don't have it. We don't have that need today. But never say never. Maintaining good relationships with our partners is still an important objective for us and we continue to do that. However, at this time, that the access to opportunity would really be the biggest check for us in terms of where we would need to access third-party capital, That’s how we're thinking about it today. We have  partners really appreciate our partners. We appreciate the relationships with our partners, and we will continue to sit side-by-side with them. But for new capit al at this point, it's not necessarily high on our priority list."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Ki Bin Kim . . You guys have been able to achieve a high level of leasing velocity. I'm just curious about how deep that demand is and is the velocity at which the top of the funnel is being fed with additional pipeline. Is that -- how is that looking compared to the number of deals you've been signing to-date?
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Thompson Yes. Ki Bin, this is Jim. Yeah, the velocity has been really good. And as I look at it, I think it's a combination of basically a renewed confidence in the brick and mortar business from retailers certainly pent up demand for -- from a year-and-a-half of really not a lot of activity that's opening up. And obviously, we continue to see a nice migration to quality, which we believe we are that answer to migration. But the categories that we're seeing are the ones we've merchandised to for the last 20 years. So we're doing a lot of medical deals, pet deals, restaurant, fast-casual, banks, personal service, and the demand is really across all regions. It's really -- it's almost imperceptible where there's more demand than others because it's coming from everywhere. Like I said, the pipeline as we look at our existing pipeline into the 90-day future, if you will, it continues to look very robust. We have more vacancy than we've had in a long time. We have product, we have availability, and there appears to be good solid retailer demand for that and so I'm cautiously optimistic we stay on a nice trajectory."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ki Bin Kim . And want to ask about your leasing spreads. The new lease spreads were essentially flat, but you are using less Capex than many of your peers as a percent of rental value or just whole dollars, just help us better understand this dynamic and the choices behind it?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Thompson Yeah, Jim again. I'll take that, and I appreciate you recognizing that the blended spreads is up to -- for this quarter was 5.1%, so we are on a nice trajectory there. But, in addition to those initial spreads, I think it's important, which is obviously an important metric, I like to step back and kind of take a broader look at what really is going on long term -- to create long-term sustainable NOI. I think one of the components, contractual rent st eps and our ability to manage expense recovery ratios are our key contributors. I think appropriate and prudent leasing CapEx which you touched on. That's a major factor I think in long-term earnings growth. Tenant selection, really making sure we're picking the right mix to drive synergy and traffic at our Centers but also having a mind coming out of this pandemic environment, make sure we have an eye towards relevancy and survivability of the folks we're dealing with. We want people that's going to be here with us. We don't like to churn space. And all these things matter. And in combination with what we're seeing from a GAAP and net effective rent growth at the 12% number I referenced in the remarks, I'm confident that our overall results have us on a very good vector towards the long-term NOI and earnings growth objectives that we're looking for."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Derek Johnston Hi, everybody. . In this environment, which is more attractive, development at tighter yields or strategic acquisitions like, Blakeney, add compressing cap rates and just given the competitive backdrop, which do you feel as Regency's wiser capital allocation call?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer Derek, I'd actually don't view it as an either-or choice. We like all and we are not -- fortunately, the position that we're in as I just responded to Michael not in a position where capital is scarce for us. So we are trying and continue to make progress on rebuilding our ground-up development pipeline. We are making progress on our redevelopment pipeline, and we are in the market and see a good pipeline of opportunities for acquisitions. As long as we are able to invest accretively and grow the Company's future trajectory for NOI growth and earnings growth. That's the box that needs to be checked."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Derek Johnston Got it and . And maybe back to Jim or whoever wants to talk about demand. How is small shop demand stacking up? Just looking at small shop leasing pipeline now versus pre -pandemic and really, how does it compare? And if you We're seeing outside demand, is it providing the flexibility to bring in the right Regency style merchandising mix? Of course, given the Center or are you feeling the need with the occupancy hole to be a little more flexible on concept or maybe TI is going forward? We haven't seen it yet, but just looking ahead. ."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Thompson Yeah, Derek. I think as I previously mentioned, I think the demand is there. We continue to asset manage no different today than we did pre -pandemic. We are always looking to get the right merchant at the right price to make sure they are successful and in turn, drive sales and make us successful. So, again, we -- right now the demand seems to be pretty deep. But we continue to be selective. We are generally never have been and don't intend to be fill it up with anything and hope they stick. We're very specific in our merchandising mix and really try to make good long-term decisions."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Craig Schmidt . I was wondering if I could get an update on the Serramonte Center, particularly with J.C. Penney space and then the Crossing Clarendon."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer I think was I knew I wouldn't be out to help myself from jumping in. Those are both tremendous assets and we're, as Jim mentioned, we're continuing to harvest value from those and grow NOI and both of those assets are going to have outsized NOI growth in the near future."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Craig Schmidt And that's good. Its over a 30-year redevelopment dollars. So the other question I had -- and I love the truducken reference.
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Craig Schmidt Truducken yeah. I was -- when I was examining it during our time putting all 3 pieces together. But you guys did it. Hats off.
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Craig Schmidt Anyway, the G&A costs, I'm just wondering, we expect a pretty decent increase in 2022 with increased travel or have you guys been relatively active throughout 2021 that's not going to have a significant pickup."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Mas I lost my life status on Delta. That means that thing. So we are anticipating a significant increase [Indiscernible] I was just going to say I appreciate you asking the question. It does give us the opportunity to put this out there. 2021's run rate on a quarterly basis is in the $19 million range or so. And again, I'll refer to my remarks, recall that we are benefiting this year from that $2 million forfeiture benefit upon max departure. Next year's run rate is probably going to be closer to the $21 million range on a quarterly basis. What we're capturing in that number is compensation increases together with filling open positions, some of the benefit we've been occurring in '21 as we've been running a little bit lighter from a headcount plan perspective. Increases the T&E, as you mentioned, the entire Company is -- we're starting to get back on the road and there's more conference is being held, businesses being conducted more in-person than on Zoom going forward. And so we're planning for that to return to pre-pandemic levels. And then the point I'd make is development overhead. Probably going to be in the flat range '21 as we continue to build our pipelines. We have the development spend will look a lot in 2022 like it did in '21. And then we anticipate growing that ability to capitalize '23 and beyond."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Hill Hey, , guys. First of all,  for being strategic when you're hosting this call. This is a first call I've had in a while where I'm not double or triple booked, so  very much. I have 1 key question about 4Q, and then 1 sort of bigger picture question. On 4Q, can you maybe provide us any thoughts on rents becoming straight line and how that will look in 4Q? I noted that moving tenants from cash basis to accrual accounting was around $0.03 in 3Q. So any thoughts on what that might look like in 4Q?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Jim Thompson From your lips to God's ears. I completely agree with you on the complete understand [Indiscernible]
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Hill So bigger-picture question, occupancy. Look, we've noted in the past, and very correctly, that occupancy is the key to getting back to normal. You continue to have really good leasing trends. Can you maybe talk about where you feel occupancy is going to get back to normal? Is that a year, 2 years, 3 years? I recognize I'm asking the shake your crystal ball here, and my crystal ball is not  right now, so hopefully yours is a little bit better than mine."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer We haven't given guidance in occupancy. I think one of the best metrics or measures is when we expect to get back to 2019 annualized levels, and that is now in the first half of 2022. So we are getting the benefit of some contractual rents along the way, which may offset a little bit of the occupancy, but I don't want to get out of -- get in trouble with any future guidance, but I think next year and into 2023, we should continue to see some occupancy left. So maybe sometime in 2023."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Hill Yeah, that's , Lisa. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to get you to talk about '22.I was just"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Lisa Palmer I was looking at Mike the whole time I answered that Rich to make -- making sure I wasn't getting in any trouble.
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Hill No, I was really just talking about the cadence of occupancy returning to normal. Not as a comment."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer 2022 we'll benefit from some of the redevelopment, NOI growth that we talked about and contractual rent steps that are already embedded. While we'll be back to that 2019, it doesn't necessarily mean that occupancy is all the way back at that time, which is a good thing, because that means we still have more room to grow."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Richard Hill Got it. Look, as someone that grew up in the South, I certainly know what a Turducken is. , guys. Congrats on a nice quarter."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Mueller Hi. Lisa, I think you talked about cap rates on high-quality centers being 4.5 to 5. Looking at your dispose this year, they're 5.5% to 6%. I guess, how much of that 5.5 plus cap rate product do you still have in the Company?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Michael Mueller Okay. And then maybe just switch gears for a second here. Do you see any other JV winddowns or buyouts over the next few years.
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Mas I think building on the comment Lisa made earlier to Michael Bilerman question, there's nothing to count on there. We 'd like our partners a lot and they've been good to us for a long period of time. And it's been a very symbiotic relationship. And so we -- I don't know, Mike, that I'd count on our ability to do a trade like the USA transaction, but never say never, and we can't predict what their plans are from a retail exposure perspective. And there may be an opportunity that Regency is presented with to consider buying in a JV partnership and we would do that. We like the assets equally that are in those portfolios. There is no fundamental kind of qualitative difference between the assets in our JV portfolios and what's on Balance Sheet. So we'll take it day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter. But it would take a shift in our partners mentality right now. Today, our partners are committed to the space, very specifically to the grocery -anchored neighborhood shopping center sector."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Powell Hi, . Question on I guess, base rent collections, the 2 laggers are personal service and fitness, but we're seeing some pretty big improvements in activity in those sectors real - time. So just curious, could you see an improvement in those 2 categories really by the first half of next year do you think?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jim Thompson Yeah, I would say the answer that is yes. And really the lag that you're seeing today is predominantly West Coast where they were the most impacted and the last to recover and with some certain mask mandates and COVID requirements that has still probably impacted those two categories in the West Coast more than anywhere else. But they're all -- they're basically on the rise. Large format fitness has bounced back very nicely. It's really more than smaller boutique folks that have been with limits. And again, predominantly West Coast. But what we see strong -- strong growth in that sector and fully expect them to bounce back."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Anthony Powell Got it. . and how much of the strong leasing demand has been driven by retailers trying to expand their last-mile distribution capabilities? We've heard some of your peers talk about that and it seems like a pretty strong secular tailwind for the industry. So what are you seeing on that front?
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer Let's rewind back to pre-pandemic. You would have heard us speaking about retail headwinds, and -- but that we were confident that retailers placed a very high value on the right real estate, on the right bricks-and-mortar locations. And that the -- if you're on the -- if you are in the right trade area and the right market, retailers would be willing to essentially pay full market rents for that real estate. And that, I would say, is what's happened over the past 20 months with the disruption -- with the hyper accelerated digital commerce, that's only been validated even further that it is really important to be close to consumers homes in quality real estate. I do believe that there has been an increase in demand, maybe a little bit pent up as people were were a little cautious as to how the pandemic would play out. But now with hindsight being 2020, the retailers have even more confidence in the importance of being close to the consumer because they do need to be more intentional about last-mile distribution. And the quality of that real estate matters. And I think that there is no question. That is what is driving increased healthy demand to Regency shopping centers."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Linda Tsai Hi. At this point in the cycle would you consider slightly higher leverage to generate higher returns given your low leverage, the positive retailer environment, and access to capital?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer Mike might be a little bit too humble, so I'm going to pound our chest a little bit more. And I think it's something we are really proud of. The fact that we're at 5 times, with or without prior period collections and with not -- with maintaining our dividend throughout the pandemic. So we did not cut our dividend. And in fact, if you read the press release and listen to our prepared remarks, we just raised it anot her 5%. Sector leading free cash flow without reducing our dividend, increasing our dividend, and still having 5 times net debt-to-EBITDA, I'm really proud of that."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Linda Tsai That's impressive for sure. And then also, I read about OP drive-thru grocery opening its first sight in South Carolina. Our existing Brewster's considering adding drive - thrus, I realized both these is similar in concept, but do you see this as emerging trend? And is this an added benefit having this type of offering at a center?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Wes Golladay Hey, everyone. I want a quick question on the uncollected rents, huge improvement going from 10 million to 4 million in the third quarter from the second quarter, do you have any expectation that we'll come down further in 4Q and then when you guide to next year by the midpoint of next year being back 2019 levels, how do you see this $4 million number playing out?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Mas Hey, Wes, I think it ties into the comments I made at the top. It's effectively the result of that bad debt expense ratio or that uncollectible lease income rate, finishing the year at 1.7%. We're at 2.5% now, so, yes, we are anticipating that number will decline in the fourth quarter. And then I would anticipate that it would continue to decline next year. We're do -- we're moving that net effective rent-paying. I can see a, again, 200 basis points this quarter. We need to compress that to within 50 basis points of commenced occupancy, at which time we can stop talking about it. Because 50 bps spread to commence is historically average. So yes, I do anticipate that number to slowly grind down from here."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Wes Golladay I guess maybe, building off of that comment, so you have -- would you assume all these people to stay in occupancy but just become paying [Indiscernible] attrition from this group."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Mas Yes. I think we believe around this tale that more of those will be survivors than move outs. And to Jim's point earlier, some of this is category-driven and geography-driven. Getting into West Coast, a couple of months behind, getting them back up on their feet. These uses that are more impacted than others in that geography. I think it's just a matter of time. We will have some move outs, but we don't -- we anticipate on balance more of those just converting back to rent-paying status."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Wes Golladay Got it.  for the time and look forward to catching up next week. Yeah.
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paulina Rojas Schmidt . I will imagine high labor costs or lack of labor availability is accelerating retailers focus in technology to make their businesses less labor-intensive. Of all the potential disruptors ahead, and there are many, and more massive adoption of cashierless stores, farther warehouse automation, driverless cars, etc., what these think are the most relevant for you as landlord, of course? Are you keeping a closer eye on any one in particular? Of course, there is no good or wrong answer. I'm only looking for your general thoughts."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer Yeah, I appreciate the question, Paulina. We're really making sure that we are thinking about being proactive to the extent that we can be proactive whether it be with simply relationships with our retail tenants and our merchants, or whether it's what we can do internally. It's all of the above. I'm going to try to -- there's no question that the most impactful because I believe it's permanent is more of the BOPIS and the last mile distribution. And we have seen that accelerate over the past 24 months. And our retailers and our merchants, as you alluded to, are getting smarter about it and are investing more money in technology. But at the same time they also, as I just said in my prior response, they also appreciate and value that last mile distribution being close to a consumer's home. And I've said it on other calls, and if you would listen to a panel with something that I did at a conference in September, we had a target real estate representative on the panel and he said it was like  90% of their orders are fulfilled from the stores. So that is probably the thing that we think about the most to make sure that we're staying as close to in evaluating how can we take advantage of those opportunities, how can we actually play a part in that and play a role in that and partnering with our retailers. And then of course, supply chain disruption, as Jim talked about, and labor shortages are something that we hope are temporary and transitional. I think that there's probably a little bit more evidence that the labor shortage may be recovering a little bit faster. And that really does impact us and impacts our -- by impacting our tenants so far more than the supply chain has. So it's all the above and we used the terms we.re on our front foot for investments. We're on our front foot for ensuring that we're staying ahead and evolving with not just changing retailer and merchant preferences, but also changing consumer preferences. Really thinking about the next 10 to 12 years."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Paulina Rojas Schmidt . And then another question, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I think embedded rent lease bumps for 80% of the leases executed this quarter. Is the remaining 20% exclusively comprised by anchors or you also have flat at rent for some small shop?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Mike Mas It's really just a kind of across-the-board split. It's not -- It's predominantly presently anchor driven. You're getting increases from that vast majority of your shops.
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Tammi Fique . I'm curious with the fallout from the pandemic that you experienced and the importance and cost of omnichannel. Has there been a general shifting to more national tenants across your portfolio or has the local small shop tenant as a percent of GLA or ABR remained steady versus pre -pandemic?
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Mike Mas So we haven't seen a real shift from that.
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Tammi Fique Okay  And then I'm curious on. On the acquisitions, what are the unlevered IRRs that you are targeting today and has that changed at all as cap rates have compressed?"
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer The thresholds for us are really going to come back to again as I spoke about earlier, it's going to -- it will certainly depend upon our cost of capital that we're using to fund the acquisitions. Because whatever we are acquiring and adding to our portfolio, in addition to being accretive to our future growth rate, also should be accretive to our earnings growth rate, so with that said, I mean today we can, with our cost of capital, we could make unlevered IRRs in the 6% range work. And that's been relatively consistent for quite some time now."
4466191,Regency Centers Corporation,REG,11/5/2021,CEO Lisa Palmer on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Lisa Palmer , Danny. And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Lisa Palmer for closing remarks.  all for your interest and participation today. Always appreciate our conversations. Look forward to talking again soon. I think next week with a lot of you. Have a  weekend. And this concludes this conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time.  for your participation."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Insoo Kim  and  for all the disclosures today on this. My first -- maybe for Ted, just trying to reconcile the walk to the 2022 guidance midpoint of the 390, couple of things that stood out, it seemed like the depreciable plant, maybe the DNA component of it is seemed a little bit higher than what I was expecting and then the pension item also something. I don't know if it was just me or if that was already known, but could you walk through a couple of those items in as much detail as possible? And finally, you talked about that sales growth that's very robust, but it didn't seem like that was explicitly laid out in this walk, so what's being assumed here?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Theodore Geisler Happy to and . First, depreciation is certainly a drag, particularly given that the test year for this case has been over 2 years ago, so we've continued robust investments since then, and that certainly has an impact going forward. We haven't detailed out anything beyond the fact that ongoing depreciation until we file our next case, certainly as an impact, and given the outcome of this case, that definitely shows next year. With respect to the pension, we've benefited from favorable market returns this year. We still expect there to be a benefit next year, but because our pension is in such strong status. We continue to re-balance the risk pension, that certainly gives us a view that we'll have likely less market returns next year, in terms of favorable mom service credits. That's really just a factor of continuing with our liability driven investment strategy, and diversity in the pension going forward. Finally on sales growth, we can't say enough about the economic developments that we see in our service territory. We try to look beyond the COVID impact. For example, if you look at growth in 2021 compared to 2019, and really just avoid the comparison to 2020, given the COVID anomalies, we're at over 6% with the normalized sales growth right now. And that is all through customer growth and usage increases, absent any COVID impacts. And that's before some of our large industrial customers that are under construction now come online, TSMC being one of them. We look at the record, housing permits levels, the amount of development that's going on right now and really believe strongly that the growth going forward is solid and based on economic development. And that's why we're comfortable with the range from 22 to 24 being in the 3.5 to 4.5% standpoint. This year we're at the range of 3% to 4%, and last quarter we already exceeded that range, so we believe those are good numbers going forward."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Insoo Kim Okay. So the 3-90 that assumes at least at a 3% year-over-year weather normal low growth?
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Insoo Kim Okay. Got it. And my second question is for Jeff. Just more broadly, definitely A challenging case. And as we think about moving forward from here, and getting to file that next rate case and having further dialogue with the interveners and the commission. What are just some things that, in your mind, you could do to this time around have a more constructive dialog overall and various issues? Just curious on your overall thoughts given, with all [Indiscernible]"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner  for the questio n too. I think that's one of the more important things we were ended up having some of the discussion about long-term negative impacts that happen, credit rating downgrade issues, things like that. That was happening at the open meeting instead of ahead of time. And so -- I think one of the important things, just as we are working very hard to be as transparent as we can be with you is to then be as transparent as we can be with all the different parties that would likely participate in that next case. I think that we do have an area of significant alignment when you look at the move towards, more clean energy deployment and how we do that and just connecting the dots to say that if you're going to actually meet the growth that we're seeing in the state. And at the same time, begin this transition and what are the benefits, one of the key things. If you go back to general Marcus Peterson’s letter asking, on how we could move to a $0.09 rate, I don't think that's realistic given the fuel mix that we have here in Arizona, it's a  topic of conversation around how we do things like fuel-for-steel. So if we can reduce our fuel burn, and the billion dollars that we spend on fuel, and replace that with batteries and storage, it can really manage rate pressure. But that's going to have to be an investment that we need to have the ability to invest in. So to me, it's really connecting all those dots, and working with the stakeholders ahead of time, and making sure that, as much of that conversation as possible takes place before we file. I think Ted mentioned, it takes about 4 months to get ready for a filing. We intend to file pretty quickly. But the idea is we've got to have that conversation, so that people can put in context, what a decision like this actually means, and meeting Arizona's growth, and managing and transition to clean energy. So it's going to be a lot of dialogue. It's not just with the commission, is with the stakeholders that will be involved, but that makes the start on that."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith . . Really appreciate the time questions. Wish you guys the best here. I know it's a difficult situation. Maybe if I can just pick it up from where Insoo left it off, how are you thinking about next steps towards about the SCR here? I noted your commentary, it didn't specifically, if I didn't catch it right, mention follow-up and litigation. How are you thinking about that side, whether it's securitization, litigation, ultimate operations of Four Corners, as well as just coming back to this question on settlement? I know there's been some open debate as to whether or not the commission or staff specifically can settle. I know the chair made some comments in recent weeks as well. Is there an ability to settle right now as best you perceive it? Certainly you seem to suggest so in the commentary, but also separately, the wider conversation on next steps, which I imagine is somewhat fluid on the SCR as well."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner Yes Julien. Let me be really direct with that. I did have it in my initial comments, but our first step in the near-term approach with the SCR is to pursue judicial review. And so what we have to do is we have to go to the commission first. You have to ask for rehearing. That's -- we have 20 days to ask for rehearing. The commission has 20 days to act on that If they don't act on it within 20 days and it's deemed denied and that opens up than your access to the courts. And so I won't go into the more detailed strategy, but we were very clear in the hearing that this is -- the prudent standard that was used just does not match the record in the case. And so we were very clear that -- I think we gave them one option to say if we could do a debt return, that we would be able to move forward with that. But as a partial recovery that they gave, which means there was a disallowance of the $216 million doesn't leave us a choice but to go to court on that issue. So that's the near-term process. What happens down the road with securitization? I mean, those are all things later. With respect to getting an unsettling, I think one of the things that this case did show is, the challenge of not having a settlement where you do have a more limited, scope of issues to look at. This was pretty wide open in terms of everything that was involved, for both the hearing division, the parties, and then ultimately the commissioners. I think we would continue to advocate for settlement as being a better outcome, because you are able to do a lot of those trade-offs, with the parties who are most effected. Rather than having it go to a commissioner, a judge for an opt-in can be a binary outcome, somebody's going to lose it all or they're going to win it all. In a lot of cases that compromise is much better. So I still think that that's the best path moving forward. That's what we would be working towards. And again, we're going to have this period of time when we finally get out of ex part to hopefully be able to have some conversation with policymakers on how to make this more constructed."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. Yes. I hear you on that. And then more broadly on this 5 to 7, I mean, how are you thinking about regulatory recovery and rate case support for that and the cadence of that 5 to 7 through the future forecast period. I'll let you define that. I just want to understand what this means for '23 and '24, and maybe understand a little bit on -- especially on the robust sales growth. Can you drive earnings growth independent of a rate case in the medium-term? Just given the pace of investment that you're articulating and rate case."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Theodore Geisler Well, Julien, the way I think about that is, as Jeff said, we plan on filing the next case as soon as practical, given the outcome of this recent one. We assume a conclusion of that before 2024, and we're being conservative on our assumption of just with reasonable regulation. And the conservative outcome in that case, we can support 5% to 7% earnings growth. An d it will just depend on the details of that next case. I think, given the sales growth, our commitment to cost management, we've got the ability to offer a favorable construct to many stakeholders, that could lead to a constructive outcome for everyone, but it will depend on those details in determining how long we go then after that, before a renewed and file another rate case. But the 5% to 7% is supported by reasonable regulation and a balanced outcome in the next filing."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Julien Dumoulin-Smith Better than just have it. As you think about the prospects for regulatory recovery, by the time we get to 24-25."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Theodore Geisler Well, that's a long-term target. So in the near-term, you could be better, it just depends on the outcome. But over the long term, we believe 5 to 7 as a prudent range."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Julien Dumoulin-Smith . I'll pass it over. I know there's a lot to ask.
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shahriar Pourreza Just a couple of questions here. First, I just wanted to follow up on Julien's question. Just curious how you expect  the litigation, I guess to affect the next rate case, and any sense on timing of the judicial review. And Jeff, more importantly, if you're trying to align with the different stakeholders. I guess why appeal, given that your plan obviously seems to support this outcome? Why not sit out, work with the stakeholders? I guess could the litigation mar the future filing from a settlement and dialogue perspective?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner Sure. It's maybe one of the most important things. That's just how the prudent standard was applied in this case. And I tried to make it very clear during the open meetings, that this is more than just $216 million write-off. That is not good, and I don't think that qualified as -- by the evidence of the case, but when you start thinking about the number of investments that we need to put in, and if every time we do that, there's a look backwards to say, \""Well, maybe there's a different technology that would've been better or cheaper.\"" It makes it really hard to think about how you're going to navigate this clean energy transition. And so I think we were trying to be as transparent and as clear as we can be with the commission when we were in the open meeting about what we would have to do given this outcome. And so that's unfortunate, I mean, I would much rather not be in that position. But as we move through that, I don't think anybody is going to be surprised by it. And the point is to say, let's figure out how we can align on what we can align on. That's part of the part of the regulatory structure as sometimes companies appeal. You got a right to appeal, that's set up in the framework. We're not doing anything more than we have the rights to do, but we still need to work together and we still need to work collaboratively through that. We'll have to do what we can do to try to navigate that."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shahriar Pourreza Got it. And then just on the equity fund, it seems like the commission has left the equity lenders alone as long as they stay consistent with past levels. I guess it's good to see there's some rationale, you highlight that may justify the GRC outcome, and how it could be somewhat anomalistic, but you do have another GRC coming up which had equity needs in of itself. Now, you're erring that this order as it stands today, you seem somewhat under equitized. I know you're deferring the equity, but it's not going away, I guess how should we think about your prior equity guide coupled with sort of the recent order, which can be somewhat offset by maybe use the apparent leverage and low growth. I mean, is there a scenario Ted, that where you wouldn't need any equity in '24? So how do we think about the bookends?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Theodore Geisler Yeah, I appreciate that Shahr. The way we think about it first is, any Pinnacle debt that's injecting APS will be treated as equity at APS of course. The second early more fundamental, we just don't believe that it's prudent issue comment at the current valuation. With respect to whether we could differ beyond 2024 depending on this outcome, that will just depend on the next outcome. As we stated, we'll also evaluate alternatives when the time comes, such as hybrids or forwards, or convertibles, to mitigate for the dilution at that time. But heading into the next rate case, our primary focus will be improving the ROE that we believe is unjust, not appropriate. Given as Jeff mentioned, the growth that we need to finance as well as the responsibilities we have, as operating in the nation's largest clean energy asset and I believe that our Balance Sheet profile having in next case will allow us to then focused on improving that ROE"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shahriar Pourreza Got it. , guys, for this and I appreciate the color. See you next week."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Theodore Geisler  sir. . Our ne xt question today is coming from Sophie Karp at KeyBanc. Your line is live. You may begin.
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Sophie Karp I guess a couple of questions here. First, on your operating expense, this OpEx guide for 2022, I'm just curious what levers you have to keep that service alive and maybe modestly down versus what we've seen in 2021. How are you thinking about that?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Theodore Geisler Well, Sophie, first of all, just want to make sure we're clear that the grid access charge going away is revenue neutral. So that really is just a cost shift between customer classes. But our estimates for whether normalized sales growth is net of energy efficiency or rooftop. So if you were to look at the gross numbers, they are even higher than what we're projecting. And again, as we sit here today, over 4% weather-normalized sales growth currently, that's higher than our current range. And if you compare it to 2019 where we're 6%, so we're confident in that weather-normalized range going forward, even with the impacts of energy efficiency and rooftop solar."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steven Fleishman Hi. . Somebody asked this question before, but I'm not sure I heard the answer. The 5% to 7% growth rate that you've laid out, Is that something you see consistent over this period, or is there some maybe lag upfront, and then when you get the rate relief it goes higher? Could you talk a little bit about the year-by-year of that?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner Steve, happy to -- it's difficult to break down year-by-year, but I think the main point that you're getting at is it certainly is an unreasonable regulation in the next rate case. We will continue to have growth based on our organic growth in the service territory. But we believe with reasonable regulation and what we're estimating as a conservative outcome in the next rate case than that'll really propel growth in that long-term earnings range target. So certainly, I will be looking for the filing that'll be coming forward sooner rather than later and the outcome of that next case to project over the long term. And that's why that range is over the next 5 years."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steven Fleishman Okay. I'm just going to ask maybe a little more clearly on the question. Just so -- because I think for the next rate case, you're really not going to have in place till late '24 did you say or?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner Well, it depends on the schedule, but if you file in '22, I think it's reasonable to expect an outcome in '23."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steven Fleishman Okay. So there's only really one year, '23, without the outcome of the rate case? By '24 you expect you will have it in place?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner Yeah. And actually, I think if we file in '22 it's possible to get an outcome in '23 consistent with schedules we've had in the past. And therefore, you have some resolution in '23 and then your first full year is '24."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steven Fleishman Okay. . And then maybe ju st on the -- in terms of understanding the kind of equity. So you plan to, I assume, keep the ATS equity at the 54, and change that's authorized in this last case."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner Well that was the equity from the last test year. We'll measure the equity at the end of this next test year, and that'll just be whatever it is, that will be exactly what we file. But again, our view is while you will have equity injection based on Pinnacle debt, we are more focused on trying to prevent further dilution during this period, and then really focused to filing on improving our ROE."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Steven Fleishman Right. And is there any risk of them imputing that, or is there not any history of that?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner We don't believe there's risk, and we believe that the commission will understand that we have to lever the Company in order to keep funding the growth in this state. And that's the position they put us in as a result of the outcome of this recent case. So I view that as little risk."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell Hey, .  so much for the detail on the slide. If I could just follow-up on Steve's question. So you're saying that commission doesn't really care or has historically not cared about double leverage. Is that accurate?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner It's really not been anything that's been a focus and, I can't speculate on what that may look like in the next rate case filing are they the key is that with our record growth, we have to finance that somehow. And given the outcome and the impact that's had on our valuation, the prudent way to finance it, is to use the strength of our Balance Sheet. And I believe the Commission will understand that."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell It's more of maybe the double leverage hasn't been presented that a commission historically versus that they either approved or disapproved that, fair."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner Anthony, I don't expect it to be an issue."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell Then if I think of high-end of rate case guidance at 6%, our high end of EPS guidance is 7%. Are you assuming either improved our ROEs or minimizing some regulatory lag to get to that? If you hit the high end of rate-based guidance, how do I hit the high end of the EPS guidance?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner I think the key there is, over time, is really going to be improving regulatory lag, which has been a focus of our team all along. And I believe that we've been clear as well that improving regulatory lag also allows us to stay out of rate cases. So that will definitely be a key focus in this next filing. Certainly improving ROE to be commensurate with peers is also a driver as well."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell . And then just lastly, you made a really good distinction about maybe the disallowance on the SCRS was related to legacy coal plant, and a lot of the capex going forward, is more monetizing the clean energy. But given any type of risk of new technology or something coming up, supplementing it and now the commission playing Monday morning quarterback with that capex, does that give you any hesitancy on going with any big projects or limiting the value of any type of projects so that your risk of this allowance is much smaller, maybe what we saw in the SCR order or decision?"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner Every 2 -- I guess 2 parts that will -- so one is the -- that's -- again, one of the important reasons for why we had to seek review of the case is because getting clarity around not -- we make the decisions based on the information that we have at the time we make the decisions to move forward in a prudent way. And there is a lot of new technology that's coming in. So I do think probably everybody in the industry is trying to figure out, how do you de -risk new technology projects. So you don't run out Look at, for example, our battery storage work. We've put a pause after we had the McMicken event, so that we could deeply, deeply understand safety around lithium-ion utility scale batteries. We're now moving forward in a pretty aggressive way with those systems, but they are established technology, they're known. There's more of them being installed. We're not first movers on it and so I think that you'll see a lot of work on. I'm trying to make sure that we're managing that risk because I think it's a good point, but one of the important things for us was to get clarity on, now that you don't use hindsight to go back and look at what was an appropriate decision when circumstances have changed."
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Anthony Crowdell .  so much for taking my questions, I'm looking forward to seeing you guys at [Indiscernible]"
4466205,Pinnacle West Capital Corporation,PNW,11/5/2021,CEO Jeffrey Guldner on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jeffrey Guldner Next to Anthony. . . That was our last question for today. I will now turn the call over to management for any cl osing remarks. . . And just -- I just want to thank all of you for your investment and your confidence in us. This rate case outcome was not what we had hoped for but we are focused now on our path forward, and are focused on our customers, and look forward to seeing some you at [Indiscernible] and  again, that concludes our call. , ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day.  for your participation."
4467042,Viatris Inc.,VTRS,11/8/2021,CEO Michael Goettler on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Schott .  so much for the questions. I know you're targeting a January 7th Analyst Meeting, but do appreciate the comment on, I think it was $6.2 billion in EBITDA as a fore for the business. I guess my question here was, in the past you've talked about 2021 as a trough number. I know you've raised the guidance a few times foregone through this year. So, let me just understand a little bit what's going on here. Some of the upside we're seeing, more one-time in nature this year, or are there any other factors that contribute to that dynamic? I'm just trying to bridge between a new midpoint of $6.4 billion versus that floor $6.2 billion. And if I can slip a really quick second question in. My question is, do you think about capital deployment and where your stock is right now, where does repo -- share repo fit into the mix? And if -- there's been a lot of discussion around BD alone, dividends, but trying to sense -- get a sense of the -- is share repo something that you're considering as well.  so much."
4467042,Viatris Inc.,VTRS,11/8/2021,CEO Michael Goettler on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Umer Raffat Hi guys. I'll also ask 1 question which is 2 questions. Michael, I know there's been a lot of investor questions and confusion around dividend payout. And I'm curious if we should expect a more definitive number. Let's say a 20% payout or something as we go to January 7th Investor Day. And then Rajiv, I'm trying to understand some of your comments around Botox. Somewhere a little better. I know you were scheduled to have conversations with FDA in September is what you had said last time. You also just said that the Revance complete response on manufacturing efficiencies should not impact your 2024 timing. So I'm just trying to put those two things together. I guess what specifically was FDA focused on when you sat down with them in September. And is your manufacturing process and manufacturing location for biosimilar Botox shared with Revance? ."
4467042,Viatris Inc.,VTRS,11/8/2021,CEO Michael Goettler on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Elliot Wilbur . . Wanted to ask a question around synergy realization over the course of the year and I apologize some of the lines were cut off, I may have missed this during Rajiv's prepared commentary, but just wanted to get an update on where you were in terms of realizing the $500 million in targeted synergies, which buckets are over-performing or underperforming versus original expectations. And then just looking at the numbers in terms of SG&A and R&D, targeted spend percentages and those numbers on an absolute basis, as well as COGS. They're not really moving lower. So, how should we think about the progression of those numbers kind of on an absolute basis as we move toward that ultimate target of $1 billion in synergies. ."
4467042,Viatris Inc.,VTRS,11/8/2021,CEO Michael Goettler on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jason Gerberry Hey guys.  for taking my question. My question is on China and just as we think about this $300 million headwind that was talked about heading into the year. It looks like it's un -impacted. The URP price impact probably pushed out to next year, arguably which is probably the big swing factor with the floor -- EBITDA floor as we think about that next year. So I'm just curious, are you seeing anything on the China retail side which has been a growth story that suggests some of this upside that you're seeing in China in '21 is sustainable? And if I could just squeeze in a point of clarification, there was mentioned about out-of-pocket assistance on Semglee, which I would think of as a generic having negligible patient out-of-pocket costs. So, if you could just provide some clarity on what the co-pay differential would looked like on a Semglee versus an established brand that'd be helpful. ."

Can you give us more details on what drove the better free cash flow for your guidance. And maybe if you could discuss the improvement, the cash improvement initiatives and so we expect a higher free cash flow growth in 2022 above the reduction in 1-time costs. And then a follow-up on China, do you expect a more benign [Indiscernible] impact or just a postponement of the reform. ."
4467042,Viatris Inc.,VTRS,11/8/2021,CEO Michael Goettler on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gary Nachman . . In terms of the competitive dynamics for some key complex generics, is this thin line better or worse than what you've been expecting? I'm curious if you're getting the returns on your complex generics that you expected a couple of years ago, given competitive dynamics there. And then just gross margin, it showed good improvement relative to our expectations in the third quarter. So how should we think about that trending going forward? It will be down a little bit in 4Q, but what are some of the pushes and pulls there maybe going into next year? ."
4467042,Viatris Inc.,VTRS,11/8/2021,CEO Michael Goettler on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nathan Rich . s. Sanjeev, maybe just on the cadence of earnings into 4Q, can you maybe talk about what drives the step-down in EBITDA. I know you talked about China as well as this seems like EpiPen sales might have been pulled forward a little bit. But fourth quarter is normally a seasonally strong quarter, so I just like to get a little bit more color on the cadence for the final quarter of the year. And what gets you to the low versus the high end of the range. And then at a high level, are you kind of willing to maybe preview some of the key like tailwinds and headwinds that we should have in mind for '22 and '23 ahead of the analyst day? ."
4467042,Viatris Inc.,VTRS,11/8/2021,CEO Michael Goettler on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ronny Gal  And  for squeezing me in. A couple of actually really small points. First, your Eylea IPR was supposed to have an answer by the 5th of November. It seems to be delayed somewhat. Can you give us an update, what's happening there? And second, I noticed the Orencia biosimilar that you're disclosing. A few other companies have tried that and found it's very hard to keep Orencia stable in storage, just the way the molecules made. And I kind of wonder if you over that hump and find a way to resolve it or is it still ahead of you?"
4467042,Viatris Inc.,VTRS,11/8/2021,CEO Michael Goettler on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Amsellem . I wanted to ask a high-level question, just in light of what Novartis commented regarding Sandoz and particularly their challenges with their U.S. business, and then in light of how your business is form and is evolving. Can you give us some color as to how you're thinking about your base -- U.S. generics business and just your overall U.S. small molecule retail presence over time, particularly the more commodity into the business? Can you just talk to how you're thinking about that philosophically? ."
4467042,Viatris Inc.,VTRS,11/8/2021,CEO Michael Goettler on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Rajiv Malik So, David -- Yes, U.S. has been one of our core business and we have lived through the various cycles over the years. And for me it cycles continue and that's nothing new. For the last few years, we knew how -- how this business is evolving. There was a commodity bucket and there was a stellar bucket of hard to make and complex for us from science perspective, we continue to invest for several years to bring up the value chain. So that's being off on a commodity is where we saw that there's a follower of the vertical integration. We still retain those where we see a huge competition and commodity means actually turning out the commodity with the 15 term market. We took the opportunity to prune that portfolio and if we're not pull together, we have a well diversified generic portfolio which is performing very well and as we expected. We have a strong customer service level, given what we're doing with the rationalization of facility [Indiscernible] in the COVID, we have not miss a beat. We have very strong service levels, so that puts us on the  position to manage the challenges as less grabbed opportunity. So, we couldn't -- I think we feel good how we all heard about this business and if we normalize the one-time events like [Indiscernible], LOE of -- or lose a lot of that exclusivity. Are we then we have righted where we forecasted mid single-digit -- mid-single-digit price erosion. So  for your question. Clearly, we've done the work ahead of other companies. All right,  very much, everybody for the question. Unfortunately, we're out of time. Let me just say we're pleased with yet again another very, very strong quarter and we look forward to seeing you at our Virtual Investor event on January 7th.  very much. This does conclude today's Viatris 2021 third quarter earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day."

I noticed a lot to talk about here, but I wanted to ask on the market rumors on Pinterest if you don't mind and I know you are not pursuing a deal at this time, But just wanted to ask if your appetite to do a large deal is still there? If your longer-term outlook hinges on adding any assets like that with different revenue sources like advertising? I know, John, you said you're not counting on M&A for mid-term, just thinking a longer-term here. ."

So pretty big news here with Amazon on the Venmo integration, especially given how protective Amazon is over their checkout flow, so congrats there and it might be helpful to expand a bit on what you talked about Dan around the agreement such as are the economics with Amazon similar to other marketplace deals that you have in place, are there opportunities to expand the relationships to other PayPal brands and services and maybe when in 2022 we can expect that to show up on the site.  very much."

I know you made some comments in the prepared remarks, but can you elaborate a bit further, give a little more color on the early impact you're seeing maybe on user growth, engagement growth, etc., including maybe some aspects so far that have surprised you? ."
4467201,"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",PYPL,11/9/2021,CEO Dan Schulman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Togut  for taking my question. Looking at the third quarter KPIs, they’re certainly strong and broadly in line with your 5-year guide, and then you called out some short-term factors and tough comparisons for taking guidance down for the fourth quarter and guiding 2022, at least, your preliminary guide below the 5-year model. But when you look at 2022, at some of the shorter-term factors, you've called out like supply chain issues and return of consumers more to the physical POS, how confident are you that some of these issues are actually shorter term versus potentially longer lasting that might stretch into 2023?"
4467201,"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",PYPL,11/9/2021,CEO Dan Schulman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Darrin Peller Hey. , guys. I just wanted to touch on the organic trends of the business, mainly the KPI Net New Actives and just maybe if you can give a little more color on the organic dynamics you are seeing now, a year and a half into COVID, in terms of gross adds versus mature levels, and we're also getting more questions on '22 guidance and some of the inputs there that you just touched on that, John, so , but thinking about the underlying, sort of user growth potential there, engagement potential, and then really just reminding us of your conviction in the drivers getting to 750 million of NNA long-term? , guys."
4467201,"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",PYPL,11/9/2021,CEO Dan Schulman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"James Faucette  very much and  for all the color and detail of things that you're going through. John, I know you kind of touched around this in your commentary, but if we think about all the irons and initiatives that you have in the fire right now, how should we think about kind of the medium-term progression of your operating margins? I know you also highlighted that you want to make investments, but just trying to make sure that we try to align our own expectations with how you're thinking about your planning purposes going forward. ."
4467201,"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",PYPL,11/9/2021,CEO Dan Schulman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"John Rainey So I'll start by saying that, I would hope that people appreciate and agree with this, but I don't think there's ever been a more important time to invest in our business than right now. This is a precious opportunity that we have with some of the secular tailwinds. We're fortunate in that the margins on our business want to go up. We've demonstrated that we can scale at a very low marginal cost, we've got tremendous opportunities some of which we've talked about today, that give us confidence that over our planning horizon, our margins will go up. That's not something that I think we lose a ton of sleep about. Quite frankly, I think the more challenging dynamic is where to invest, where we can get that return that's expected, and if you think about the last couple of years being 2020 and this year 2021, our operating expenses have grown about 20% each of those years, and I would discourage you from thinking about that as a sort of one-time spend related to customer acquisition or something like that. There's a lot of like engineering costs around people that are punching the keyboard to write code, and that's still with us today. So even as we talked about the high single-digit growth next year, that's on top of 2 years of 20% growth. But for us it’s also important not to spread ourselves too thin and to make sure that we are prioritizing appropriately and some prioritizing involves, say notice our things as well. And so I think we've laid out a pretty clear plan over the next few years with our focus on things like the digital wallet, building out commerce capabilities, continue to monetize Venmo that give us ample opportunity to invest. But as I noted in my remarks, we don't manage the business to have margin expansion for the next quarter, or frankly even for the next year. We're looking at how we create a Company over the next 5 years, that can have the same type of market value appreciation that we've experienced over the last 5 and the decisions that we make really just lineup with that much more so that trying to maximize for any particular time period. And so maybe not directly answering your question, but our margins are going to go up over the long term and we're not going to be handcuffed to doing that from one period to the next at the expense of like creating shareholder value. . We have time for one last question, comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Your line is open."
4467201,"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",PYPL,11/9/2021,CEO Dan Schulman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jason Kupferberg , guys. Hey, how are you? I guess, they're now tracking to more of the lower end of the 52 to 55 million target for the year previously thought to be closer to the higher end. So I'm just wondering, is this some incremental softness in gross adds, is it higher churn, a decline in new activations? It seems like we may be down a little bit quarter-over-quarter in Q4 but normally there is some positive seasonality. So just wanted to get your take on what’s going with the NNA? ."
4467201,"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",PYPL,11/9/2021,CEO Dan Schulman on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Dan Schulman Yeah,  Jason.  for that. If you remember we started the year at 50 million then we raised it 52 to 55 and then we thought we'd be towards the higher end of the 52 to 55. At this point, we're just being consistent with our revenue guide as well. We're going into the heart of the holiday, you're exactly right. If holiday season shapes up like it did last year, then we'll have more than 52 million organic because there would be a lot more of shopping, and if it doesn't, then we'll have a little bit less. So it's very consistent with us just being, I think prudent and cautious given some of the trends that we're seeing and others are talking about. Again, supply chain shortages, people can’t shop if consumer confidence is down, people do more in store, we’ll get less M&As than we typically might, . If the holiday season goes as it did last year, we'll get more than we are talking about right now. So I just think it's just very consistent with the guide that we gave, and again, as John mentioned, we had a good start to the quarter, we’ve had a pretty strong last week report too, but we're early on right now and so we don't like it when we are at the mid-point of our guidance or any of that kind of thing. We are used to being a Company that puts out things and then beach what it puts out, and we want to assure that what we say is appropriate and an appropriately conservative on it. So that's how I think I would answer that question, Jason. . All right. Operator, , Jason for that last question, really look forward to talking to all of you over the course of the next couple of days and weeks and at a number of different conferences, and  for all your support and your time today. . This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vasu Govil Hi,  and I wanted to congratulate Kevin on announcement of your retirement. We will be sad to see you go but now we have a couple of more quarters to talk with you. I guess my first question is on the word merger comment that I think David you make that you're seeing strength there, I know last quarter you had said that you expect it to be better this year, but it didn't seem like we were really including much in the guide. I just want to get a sense of what you're including in the guide versus what could be upside based on what you're seeing."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Foss I said in my comments, the convert merged slots and just to make sure nobody is clear when we reference convert merge, it's -- it happens when one of our institutions is acquiring another institution. They notify us well ahead of time, well before the conversion actually, or the acquisition actually happen. They notify us that they will need our help to convert the acquired institution onto the Jack Henry platform and so we hold those slots. In the past several weeks here, that volume has increased significantly, or customers contacting us to hold conversion slots and essentially sign contracts to lock those in. And so that's why -- what I said in my comments was, every conversion slot now on the banking side of our business is filled for convert merge activity through the remainder of the fiscal year, and we're evaluating whether or not we need to add more teams. And the reason for that evaluation is we have to keep an eye on, does a deal fall through? Since they notify us well ahead of time and ask us to hold a slot and they they will contract in front of them. But does that deal fall through? We have -- we've been doing this for a long time. We're very good at predicting what's going to actually happen and what's not, but everything that we have today that is known, that is booked, is worked into the guidance that Kevin provided to you, but there is more potential opportunity out there. We may stand up if demand justifies that, we may stand up an additional conversion team, or even 2 conversion teams, we've done that in the past. And so we'll just have to follow that as it goes. But what we know today is included in the guidance that Kevin has shared with you. But there is still potentially more opportunity there based on what happens with our customers. The key messaging there was just for you all to know that convert merge or M&A is back in the banking space. That not only is a real positive for us and that we have customers acquiring other customers and we generally are paid on account volume and transaction volumes. That's good for us when they get merged in. But then also for you to be aware that deconversion revenue will probably go up because we know that some of our customers will also be acquired away from us as M&A continues to grow."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Vasu Govil That's very helpful [Indiscernible] . And just a follow-up I had was on the payments segment, It has been to me coming into the quarter that morning, you would probably be the high watermark and then kind of level off from there. I didn't the revenues in the quarter were at that lighter than what we were modeling. I just am curious to see where they came in relative to your internal expectations. And I know debit volume rolled off a bit, is that probably impactful to your Payments segment? And then if you could also comment on what's going on in the bill pay business. I know softer trends across the peer group, but, but if you comment on -- if you have any insights on, is that just more competition from digital wallet or for something else which is driving bill pay revenue to be flattish"
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Foss So there's a lot in the -- on the payments line of course 3 and you highlighted there, so 3 primary components in the payments line for us. So the Payments segment for us, there's bill pay revenue, there's card revenue, dividend credit and then there is what we refer to as EPS enterprise payments solutions. The bill pay bill pay line or the bill pay business continues to be relatively flat. I mean, there's some growth, but as we've talked about on the call before, anybody who needs the bill pay solution has a bill pay solution. Volumes aren't really fluctuating. that much, so it's relatively flat in the bill pay business. The card business is continuing to grow. We're seeing nice growth not only because we're adding customers, but because now as the pandemic numbers have dropped again, here in the early fall, transaction volumes, we've seen a definite correlation between transaction volumes increasing as infections have -- reported infections have dropped. And so that's a key part. But the enterprise payments business is continuing to grow very nicely at the smallest piece of that segment. But the fastest-growing piece of that segment. And that is driven by remodel by capture, but also by it's origination's. And so we have a number of customers who have signed with that platform recently and some that we'll announce next year, I think as they come live, that we'll be continuing to drive big volumes through that platform. So it's the combination of those things, but I think are driving the payments revenue, and all of those are positioned well for continued growth in the coming year."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kartik Mehta Hey, , Dave and Kevin. Dave, I wanted to maybe get a little bit more on your sales pipeline question. I think when you spoke last earnings call, you talked about that FY2022 pipeline would be up 3% to 5%, if I remember my numbers right. And I'm wondering what's your expectations are, it sounds like things are going well, but it would be interesting what your expectations are for the growth in the pipeline for this fiscal year?"
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Foss Yeah, that's a . I have no hesitation about reaffirming 3% to 5%. Can it be er than  5%? It's little early probably for me to commit to that, but I will again say with no hesitation, 3 to 5%. And in fact on the high end of that, I easily sign up for 5% based on what we're seeing right now below the core, it's been interesting watching core deals as we've come out of the real trough of the pandemic. And obviously the pandemic isn't over, but we're deals are really lumpy right now, but there is a tremendous amount of activity as far as side of the business. And then if you look at the rest of the suite of Jack Henry, the forecasts are looking or the pipelines are looking very, very strong right now. So I'm,-- like I say, very comfortable signing up for the high end of that guide and it could be even higher but I think we need a little more time under our belt here to make sure that I'm not overextending."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kartik Mehta Kevin, I know you talked about [Indiscernible]margins in your idea, a little bit cautious, but you had an excellent quarter this quarter, it seems like margins are probably better than you thought. I'm wondering maybe your reluctance to think you will be better than the 50 basis points you talked about last fiscal year, is it just too early in your opinion or are there other things that might impact margins that we should be aware of."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Williams Yes. I mean, Kartik, there's so many moving parts this year that are coming back that weren't there last year. I mean, deconversion fees  is obviously going to be higher. As Dave mentioned, convert merge I mean, M&A activity just, just drive so many different moving parts within our financials. I mean, so obviously travel is going to be a lot higher. There's other costs, there are salespeople are getting out in travelling more so, just just the travel expense is going to be higher. May as a possible that our total margins should be higher? Yes. Obviously, the Q1 margins are proud of the highest of the year because of all the software subscription revenue that we recognized in Q1 for all the software has been delivered in the previous years. So this, this is high watermark for margins for the year. But the other thing I will say if [Indiscernible] was down almost 40% this quarter which -- which that actually helps our margins by hardware revenue being down, which is, I mean, it's samples we're but if hardware revenue would level earning will go back up a little bit for the year, because I'm sure IBM will come out with additional hardware upgrades. Could that impact our margins yes? So I mean, I'm still very comfortable that we can hit the 50 bps and could it be higher than that. Yes. But I'm separated stepping on that Lemia."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Peter Heckmann This is John on for Peter, is a quick question. Are you touched on that in the prepared remarks, but was expectation for deconversion fees. And how does it last? And then each quarter again?"
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Williams So we increased deconversion fees, we think is going to be somewhere around $42 to $43 million. And again, that's looking at the crystal ball because there -- we don't know for sure that's what's going to be that's just the indications that we're getting. But we think probably 80% of that will probably be in Q2 and Q3 based on what we know right now. So deconversion fees in Q2 and Q3 could be $15 million or so plus in each of those quarters."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Peter Heckmann Got it. . And that non-GAAP payments segment growth was 9%. What was the segments could you see that grew notably faster or slower than the segment average?
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Foss I assume you're referencing my comments earlier, John, about the three different pieces of the payments segment, is that what you are asking about?"
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Foss So 3 pieces, bill pay, our card business debit and credit and then what we refer to as EPS enterprise payment solutions, which is [Indiscernible] SCH. The Enterprise Payment Solutions business is growing the fastest, but it's the smallest of those three components. So the card business is the largest, the bill pay business, second largest. Bill Pay, really relatively flat. It's growing a little bit, but like I said, most anybody who needs bill pay has Bill Pay and volumes don't change that much in that piece of the segment. But the card business is growing nicely both because of new customers that we're adding and because of just volumes picking up again. And then the fastest is also the smallest, which is Enterprise Payments."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,David Foss Sure. . Next we have David Koning with Baird.
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Koning Yes. Hey, guys, . And I guess, first of all, just as we look at the market, we hear a lot about the super apps and how they're progressing. Is there a much different that a super app can do than what kind of Banno client that's on the Banno system can do? And do you even do some work for a lot of the super as to how to help them grow as well?"
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Foss Well, I am not exactly sure what you're including in the super app buckets. They've I mean, they others, there's lots of stuff  going on out there. We are working. So the thing about the bantle platform is -- it is built to work with an open API based platform. So modern technology stack open API based platform, you saw -- hopefully you saw the press release we did in October where we announced the partnership and integration of finicity, Akoya, and Plaid. All of those relationships are designed to provide er functionality on this digital platform to connect FinTech solutions to other FinTech solutions. Our goal with the platform is not only to offer the best experience for the consumer and small business through a single digital experience, but also to provide the best platform in the industry to create that inter-connectivity of applications to other applications. The other thing that we're trying to do through all of that, and this is important when you compare to modern technology stack like we have with Banno, as compared to other things that are out there is we are close to being able to eliminate screen scraping. And if you're not comfortable -- if you're not familiar with that term of screen scraping, that's what happens with older applications where a consumer, let's say you're trying to consolidate all of your accounts on one in one experience on one spot, one digital experience, well, the old approach, which most companies out there are using widely today is screen scraping, where the consumer provides their credentials, their log on and password into some central location, and that central location goes out on, essentially simulates being a consumer going on in pulling down balance information or you can probably imagine the security -- potential security and privacy issues that come along with that, and so we've  been working very diligently for several years to eliminate all of that in our platforms. And they use this integration that we've done with Finicity, Akoya, and Plaid. And the other moves that we've made with our digital platform have us right on the cusp of eliminating all of that well ahead of anybody else, any of our traditional competitors when it comes to offering a truly state-of-the-art digital experience."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"David Koning Got it. Yes,  because it looks to us like growth in core and really the whole business you're doing about as good or are actually better like your core segments about the best expand in a few years, In terms of growth, like it just seems like momentum is as strong as ever. There's no real like competitive changes in the environment if anything, it seems like the environment is -- is strengthening maybe for you,is that fair to say?"
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Williams And Dave, one more thing, just remember the one of the big drivers in our core growth is the continued movement of existing on - prem customers to our private cloud because we get a nice lift of revenue and move those as Dave said in his opening comments, we signed 10 more in Q1 to make that move, and we are seeing larger FIs that are on - prem, they're electing to make that move as well."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Williams , guys. Think you. Next we have Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research"
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Suchoski Hi, , David and Kevin. s here. I just want to follow-up on that last comment about the shift in a core customer from on-trend to the private cloud. I mean -- what's -- maybe you can help us understand the revenue lift that you might get from that on a per customer, per unit basis."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Williams So on average, if you look at the an on - prem -customer day, everything that they're paying us, which would be in-house maintenance could be disaster recovery, it could be hardware maintenance. There's several buckets in line items have revenue that they could be paying us. But on average, when an on - prem -customer moves to our private cloud, the revenue that we get out of that customer essentially doubles. And there is very little cost increase because remember, it's the exact same software, it's the exact same support organization. We've got the infrastructure in place of their data centers. There's very high margin from that additional revenue when we moved those customers from on - prem to our private cloud."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ken Suchoski That's very helpful. And then maybe just a question on the payments segment, it looks like on a non-GAAP basis, the growth in this segment slowed from about 17% last quarter to 9% This quarter. What drove that slowdown and I guess what are your expectations for that segment going forward?"
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Ken Suchoski Okay. And then just last one from me just on the share repurchases. I don't think you guys bought back any stock in the quarter. I think in the prior quarter you had a larger buyback. I guess thoughts on overall capital allocation at this point and what are your thoughts on repurchases at the current stock price?
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Williams Yeah. So I mean, obviously we're going to continue to buy back stock here in there. I will tell you that this quarter, one of the reasons that we were -- we didn't buy any stock back was we were actually trying to get some tax planning in place based on what the new administration was proposing on the table. Because we were going to use were potentially you significant amount of cash to pay upfront taxes for a number of reasons. But now now that the third, they are changing the corporate tax structure actually took a totally back out to where they're not even a change the 21%. It's a wildcard right now, but I mean, as the tax [Indiscernible] we figured out exactly where it's going to be. Obviously we use some of our capital buyback more stock during the year."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dominic Gabriel Okay, .  so much for taking the question. I appreciate the commentary on Banno and the partnerships with other fintechs. I guess what open APIs are typically adopted with Banno across your peers. It could you just offer that functionality in-house, maybe just discussed. The puts and takes life. Partner partnerships are the way to go versus just expanding the capabilities. Or maybe I'm just not understanding the dynamics there. And I just have a follow-up.."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Foss Sure, yes. So I -- I'll -- I'll try not to be a -- I think you're misunderstanding the dynamics, so you said it yourself and I'll -- I'll just repeat that. When we use the term partnership, that doesn't mean that we're reselling somebody else's stuff, that we're exchanging revenue, that there -- there's something like that, or that we're missing a piece, in this day and age with all of the new feature function that's happening with FinTech and with the demand that our customers, that bankers have from their customers, their consumers, to use different -- different things, different pieces of technology that they've come across. The future for banking and the future for a provider like us is to provide open connectivity so that the customer -- our customer, the banker, can choose to integrate whatever they want to integrate into our platform. What's we are moving toward -- what consumers are moving toward is, they are very sensitive to the fact that the data is their data, like I'm the consumer, it's my data, it's not your data, It's my data. And so it happens to be housed at this bank but I want to access to that data and so the bank is now more than ever very sensitive to that idea that they need to provide access to that data in a secure manner, to a variety of different sources that the consumer chooses to want to use, or that the bank may choose to want to use. So we are continuing to innovate on our technology. And the reason that the Banno platform is so well regarded and has the highest ratings in the App Store is because we have the best functionality out there. But you can't do everything, right. Not every idea that every FinTech comes up, it's just not possible to write all of that code into one application. And so providing that platform for open connectivity is the best of all worlds. It gives us this reputation of being open and being innovative, but it also provides the banker the opportunity to connect whatever they want to connect into that platform and take advantage of the data for the benefit of their consumer, whether the consumer is an individual or if it's a small business. And so what -- what we're doing today is being recognized regularly as being really industry-leading in providing that open connectivity and that opportunity for the banker to choose as opposed to us going to them and say, ''You must use our platform whether you like it or not. '' And this is not new for us. We have always been extremely open on back from when Jack and Jerry started the Company 45 years ago, we've always had -- because we started just a core provider and we had to let them use any third-party. I mean if you think about our investor confidence Dave refer to as open opening comments, I mean, we typically have well over a 100 or an over 300 other vendors at our tech fair to show up to where so we've always been open. The fact that open API's just makes it that much easier for a third-party to integrate into our core solutions?"
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Dominic Gabriel Perfect.  so much for all that clarification. I really appreciate it. And then, as you think about the net M&A activity affecting your partners, how do you think that could change the geography of your average asset size of your underlying banking credit, credit union mix? And where do you typically win, and which sized clients get taken away from the Jack Henry platform? And then, perhaps -- sorry. Just a final on this, for clients that do get taken away, and that  create these deconversion fees, what about the win back rates? Perhaps they -- the one that got taken out was using Jack Henry, really liked it, and then they explain the benefits there, and then you could win, perhaps, the entire relationship later. Does that happen? Maybe you can discuss all those factors.  so much."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Foss Dominic, you've got a lot packed into that one question, but they're things I love to talking about."
4467400,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.",JKHY,11/9/2021,CEO David Foss on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Foss Give me about an hour-and-a-half, I'll try and fill you in. No, seriously. First up, we -- when M&A happens -- I'll answer your question from the beginning and work forward. Does it happen that customers are acquired away and then they come back to Jack Henry? Yes, that happens is -- and in fact, it's more often than you might think where somebody gets acquired the logical thing is for the acquiring institution to convert them to whatever they're running. And then once they get integrated in, the people have been acquired, suddenly start to say, we had a better on the old platform than we have in a new platform let us tell you guys what we used to be able to do with Jack Henry. And it's often times the combination of the technology and the relationships. This is a relationship business partnership is a key. Part of what we do. And so often times the acquired institution will educate the acquirer on what it was like do business with Jack Henry. So we do when those occasionally. The other thing that when once in a while is what -- is let's say that an acquirer is targeting one of our institutions, we know that that's happening. We can often time sell the acquirer on converting to the Jack Henry platform as opposed to the acquirer using whatever it was they had before the -- before the acquisition was announced or before the deal was announced. And so, those -- we refer to those as winter merger, and those we've been successful at. But the heart of your question -- the beginning of your question was -- that is the power. The beginning of your question. Sorry, we have a little phone issue going on here. The beginning of your question. Most of the M&A activity is happening at the low end of the range. Real small institutions being acquired by large institutions. And we don't tend to serve the real small institution. That tends to be good for us. That usually, we are the benefactor, one of our institutions acquiring a smaller institution, as opposed to ours being acquired away. But to the very beginning of your question, what that means is, our asset base among our customers is growing because those larger customers in our base are acquiring smaller customers. And so over time, we will continue to grow as far as average asset size."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Carl Reichardt . Morning, everybody. Welcome, Paul.  for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your internal plans for '22 for orders, and perhaps talk a little bit about what you see your community count doing relative to your absorptions in which you lean on more for growth in the next fiscal year."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jessica Hansen And really rather than a focus on community count, it adds inflows quarter-to-quarter. If we start a house, we're going to ultimately sell and close it. So, we really focused on our homes and inventory, and our lot position."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld Both of which are in very, very good shape right now."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Carl Reichardt Yeah, okay. I appreciate that. . And then David, I wanted to go back to something that D.R. Horton has talked about in the past, that we don't hear too much from others is this idea of getting your cash out of land investments within 24 months of when you put it in, and I'm curious really on two fronts. One, the significant shift to options is probably allowed that to improve. but on the other hand, the delays entitlement and approval processes and finding dirt has probably hurt that. So can you talk about that goal of getting your cash out of your land investments within 24 months and how you see that changing over time? And  a lot."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Wheat And Carl to your point about extending delays and things like that, that applies when we do own our land and we're self-developing. it doesn't necessarily affect our cash return when we're working with a third-party and by buying lots because we're not buying the lots until we're ready to start homes and those approvals are in place. I would say more recently, one thing that is impacting our turns and our ability to actually return our cash in 24 months is the extension of our construction times with the supply chain delays. We have seen further elongation of our construction times. I believe on a year-over-year basis, our closings this quarter were -- the construction times were longer by about 7 weeks, which is a bit longer than we would reported last quarter and so that is a factor that is causing a bit of friction in our inventory turns right now. But, hopefully, as we achieve some stabilization on the material side over the coming year, we will see that stabilize and, hopefully, we will be -- contract again."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Carl Reichardt Than k you, Bill. And , everybody. I really appreciate the answers."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Kim Okay,  very much.  guys for all the info. I guess my first question relates to your Company's comments about affordability. I guess first, am I right to think that you're driving affordability primarily through construction into design efficiencies? Or should we think that this operates is goi ng to imply a lower gross margin? All things held constant? And then, regulated to your margin, I imagine you got peak lumber coming through your December quarter. So if lumber stays where it is right now, would it be reasonable to think that the December quarter margins is maybe likely to be the low point for the fiscal '22 year?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld Stephen, we're constantly trying to derive a more affordable total occupancy cost for our buyers, and that effort is never going to stop."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Kim Right, and I think the gist of my question was that none of that implies unnecessarily a lower gross margin, all else held constant, right?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld No, I don't -- we're not seeing that."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Kim All right. That's why I wanted to clarify. Okay. And then secondly, regarding sales restrictions, obviously really encouraging, we do an analysis of your starts and your inventory. It's certainly we agree. We saw a really big, positive inflection in your production metrics that we can see externally and so I wanted to ask you about your comment about the sales restrictions, because a layperson or somebody listening from the outside could hear you say, hey, we are reducing our sales restrictions and things that themselves will be yes, that's because demand has weakened. And so therefore, there aren't as many people on waiting list and things like that. And so I was wondering if you could clarify with maybe a little more detail, are you -- these sales restrictions which are starting to get alleviated or being relaxed, is that a sign of slowing demand or increasing supply? And assuming it's not a weakening of demand, I just wanted to go back to what you said in March. I think Jessica, that they get you a stress test that your backlog. I felt that gave a lot of comfort about affordability, I was wondering if you did that recently?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jessica Hansen As a reminder for those may not have heard the stress test commentary last quarter and just to quantify that, the stress that we've done on our backlog is if interest rates were to rise 100 basis points, what that at-risk buyer would look like, and it's generally mid-to-high single-digit percentage of potential at-risk with a full 100 basis point move, And that's really just at risks. We would not expect a total fallout in that regard. We look to document additional income, look to put those buyers and additional different mortgage products and they curren tly anticipating. we feel pretty comfortable still with the ability of our buyers from an affordability perspective."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Bouley Hey. , everyone.  and congrats on the results here in a pretty tough environment. So on the order outlook, Bill, you spoke to the Q1 uptick and I think suggesting basically 28% higher sequentially versus Q4, which is certainly well above historical norms, and not surprising as you released those sales restrictions and the inventory homes are there. Does this atypical uptick get you back to equil ibrium for lack of a better term? Or should we understand that just given your inventory position ahead of the spring that we can perhaps see yet another, I guess I'd call it unusual uptick as you kind of released those sales and continue to lessen the sales restrictions. ."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Murray I think what you're gonna see in our forward expectation on sales, it's kind of aligning with our growth in starts that we've had over the past few quarters as Bill said, as those homes come through production and reach production stages that we're confident in a delivery date, then we're able to release those to the marketplace for sales."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Bouley That's .  both for that. Secondly, on ASP's, I think the revenue guide from doing the math right, implies maybe mid to high single-digit increases in ASP's in fiscal year '22 give or take. Obviously, you're order ASP's have been north of that for two consecutive quarters, if not well north of that here in Q4. Are there any assumptions around geographic or product mix that we should be aware of that might temper closing ASP s into next year?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Wheat we're looking at the year as a whole and what our ASP will be for the year will ultimately be dependent on the spring selling season. And so the assumption that these prices for the year will be up mid-to-high single-digit, I think that's fair. We're not going to assume that prices will continue to increase as fast as they have. And so our base assumption will be there will be some moderation in sales prices. We're going to continue to be focused on affordability from an intentional perspective for our business. And so for our initial guide going into the year prior to seeing what the spring will look like, prior to seeing what the supply chain challenges will continue to be. And what that will do to us over the course of the year, we've set our ASP target as you've seen."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Rehaut , , everyone. First question, I was hoping to get a little bit of sense of how you're thinking about gross margins? At least perhaps directionally through fiscal '22 and even longer term. Understanding, obviously, a lot is in flux. But as you look through the rest of the year, obviously a lot of people are focusing on the reduction of lumber cost, as a tailwind. At the same time, you have some other headwinds in terms of additional cost inflation and I guess, assuming incentives and discounts are steady, just trying to get a sense of how you think at this point between lumber and other areas of cost inflation in the current pricing that you have in place, how things might progress throughout the rest of '22."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jessica Hansen We really don't have much visibility to our gross margin past a quarter or two, so you heard our specific gross margin guide for fiscal Q1, which was essentially relatively in line with Q4. As Bill mentioned, continued lumber headwinds in that December quarter. Some of that does back off as we move throughout next year. But ultimately, the gross margin that we achieved for fiscal 2022 as a whole is going to be dependent on the strength of the spring selling season, which we're pretty far out on. But I think we do feel with the strength in today's market, we should be in a very good position to continue to hopefully at least maintain gross margins from here. But we'll update as necessary as we move throughout the year and see how the spring unfolds and some of these supply chain pressures that are continuing to drive some cost increases."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Rehaut Right. Appreciate that. I guess also just longer term. You're in a new state of play here in terms of plus or minus around 27%. Just 3 years ago you were at closer to 20% and versus the last cycle. I think your peak was around 25.5% in 2005. Over the next 2, 3, or 4 years, as your underwriting deals today, and just curious, obviously, you underwrite them for returns, b ut there was a gross margin component in that. How should we think about a quote unquote normal or even a new normal? Again, assuming that we don't have this over the next 12 to 18 months, like a complete mean reversion to a let's say, a fuller incentive pipe backdrop or whatnot."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld Coincidentally [Indiscernible] consolidated, it's a maturing industry. My anticipation is, you're going to see more stability than typically has been associated around prior cycles. I think that there is a consistency discipline in the industry today, that has never existed."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mike Rehaut One last quick one, if I could sneak it in, how should we think about community count and sales pace in 2022 versus 2021 in terms of I think both for -- in terms of just growth from both aspects."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jessica Hansen It's going to continue to be mainly driven by absorption rather than community count. We would expect for the full year to have a modest increase in our community count. But I think as I referenced in at apparel at the outset of the call. If we have the houses and lots, we're going to ultimately selling close the house. And so that 's generally the better indicator of where our business is going and just what our absolute community count is doing."

My first 1 is on your start space in October, 8-K Ohio Homes that possess a pretty solid rate. Perhaps there's some timing benefit here. But can you walk us through some of the puts and takes to a normalized touched-pace near-term, or is this a good run rate for 2023 deliveries with perhaps upside when supply chain improves?"

My follow-up is pretty high level question to the extent you're just willing to discuss. How do you thi nk the supply chain is going to play out? Do appreciate that the visibility is not  beyond a quarter or more at best, but just given the current state, what are your thoughts on the realistic best-case, worst-case scenario playing out in fiscal 2022? Or even if you don't want to go all out to 2022, what are some of the scenarios as we enter spring selling season? ."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld From a supply chain standpoint, I think you've got some of the best companies that have ever existed in the history of the world focused on that, and I think they're going to get it figured out. And the people that we do business with are the best of the best in that industry, so I'm very confident. Was it Q1, Q2, Q3? I don't know that, but I am very confident that the people that are working on it are going to get a result, and when that happens I think we will return to an inventory conversion rate that's consistent with what we've done in the past, maybe even a little better."

Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Asher Sohnen Hi, this is Asher Sohnen on for Anthony and I just want to ask, you mentioned that you need more homes in inventory now to deliver the same number of homes. Are you able to articulate a target or maybe your normalized spec count for this kind of new normal? And then when supply chain do clear up, do you expect to reduce that spec count eventually, or because it's become like the new normal going forward?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Wheat Absolutely. When we get back to a more normalized time, we would expect our inventory turns to return back to historical norms, or as David said, or better. Historically, if you looked at the beginning of the year for us, you could take our homes in inventory and you can pretty well double that and that's what we would close the next year. Sometimes we've done a little better than that, sometimes a little worse. Given the current environment if it remains as tough as it is right now, we probably -- we will not be able to do that. Our guidance obviously would it would imply that, but absolutely. When we get back to a more normal time, we would expect to reduce our spec count and turn our inventory and focus on generating the best returns that we possibly can. This is simply a reflection of the current environment we are in, the elongated construction times we're seeing"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Asher Sohnen . And then as a follow-up, just understanding that the sales declines in the quarter is kind of a function of supply. But I'm just curious. And -- have you any -- have you seen any markets where maybe prices are starting to get a bit frothy or that you're concerned around affordability, maybe seeing some buyers start to walk away around the margins?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld And I'd also say that even though our ASP has gone up and it's not a sustainable rise quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, but it is something that I think indicates the level of demand out there when you restrict the number of houses you sell. It's a good time to be selling houses today."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Murray Those 900 homes we have that are completed and unsold, less than 100 have been completed for an extended period of time, out of almost 50,000 homes."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jade Rahmani  very much. On the land side, you said that sequentially lot costs were up 2% quarter-over-quarter. How much do you think they're up year-over-year?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jessica Hansen Give me one second, Jade. I have it. I just -- they are up about a mid-single-digit percentage, which has been pretty consistent as of last year too on a year-over-year basis."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jade Rahmani Okay. That's somewhat surprising because I think, historically, land usually appreciates in line with appreciation, or perhaps at a faster clip. Do you expect lot costs to begin accelerating? Is the moderate pace of growth reflective of the timing at which you acquired these lots?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Bill Wheat And this is one of the strengths of our  long lock for lot pipeline and our controlled lot position because we've got land and lots controlled generally at fixed prices or at known prices and so we reap the benefits of that by having a strong controlled lot position.
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Truman Patterson Hey, , everyone.  for taking my questions, and Paul, congratulations on the promotion. Just wanted to follow up on a prior question, but your '22 closings expectations up about 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. You all mentioned material shortages and multiple products currently, but David, you've made a couple of comments that you expect improvement in 2022. I'm just trying to understand what are your suppliers telegraphing you with respect to 2022 capacity. Are they adding employees, lines, etc.? Just what sort of level of growth do they think they can support?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Mike Murray Having a forward locked pipeline of over 0.5 million lots makes it pretty powerful as a conversation piece in talking with the large suppliers.
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Truman Patterson Okay, fair enough. And in your capital allocation priorities, I don't believe that I heard anything about MNA. Could you just discuss any inter -- or the level in your pipeline that you're seeing our valuation stretched at this point. Then just a second question, I'm sure it's well deserved, but could you all just run through the decision behind creating the Co-COO chair?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld And on the Co-COO program, in looking at our platform it would basically have doubled in the last five years, and during COVID trying to get places being not only from an executive officer standpoint, but from a regional president standpoint. We were asking gas to get employees and really became less and less comfortable with that, I think on the last call I might have statement about infrastructure, and then immediately had a quick talking about it because the infrastructure I was talking about was our platform, which was a dual COO roles, and then doubling our reach account. So that we're continuing to scale up our platform, to make -- to coincide with the scale-up in market share that we're gaining. We've got  people that are performed at exceptional levels. But as you move up that next step, the world changes and the skill set changes. So you've got to get young guys in a position to -- in my mind, anyway, and what we've talked about up here, you've got to get the younger guy into a position, a regional role where he is working through divisions instead of on top of divisions. And it's a training process. And so while we've got a  market, while we're scaling up in absorptions, we need to scale up in people. And Paul gi ves us the ability to touch the regional guys more consistently, and to be in new markets more consistently. As he travels, Mike travels, I travel. And by increasing the number of regions, we were then able to elevate people within divisions to leadership roles, and it's just kind of a consistent stairstep where we get more people access to that role and give them a chance to learn that job before something happens and you're forced to make a change. So it's a core of continuing to scale for our next 5 years in a row, and it's -- we've got  people and we've got an incredibly strong management team, and that's something that to be honest with you, I think about hold the time. It's the quality of our people, at that division level and region level compared to when I started with the Company or compared to when we went public, or even compared to the last cycle. What I call super-cycle [Indiscernible] So it's a -- the Company is in incredibly good position with incredibly good people. And Paul is going to help us get -- make it even better. So --"

First of all, in terms of the spring selling season, I know that you don't have visibility to it. And so there's, by definition, some degree of uncertainty. But as you look at your position and what you're seeing in the market now, could you identify these are the areas of notable uncertainty that you just won't know until you get to the spring?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld What we can control, Eric, is inventory and how we position it to be in front of the spring market, and that we feel very good about. So we can -- that is where we can have targets, we can have a plan. We can execute that plan and then we'll respond to the market as it comes."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Eric Bosshard Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, a lot of talk about affordability earlier in the call and I know there's a lot of components of affordability, but ultimately, for your customer, it's them paying the price for the house. And the order ASP, I think coming out of [Indiscernible] is now 380,000, which is certainly different than it was two or three years ago for the Company. I'm just curious how you think about that. If especially, how you think about it relative to the different products that you have and relative to markets. How do you think consumers respond to that, customers respond to that and the path forward?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jessica Hansen And as the industry as a whole has continued to increase sales prices, Generally speaking, we still do have the lowest average sales price generally than almost all the large public builders."

4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alan Ratner Hey, guys. .  for squeezing me in here. I'd love to drill in a little bit on the rental operations, obviously breaking it out this quarter, and certainly, I think over $700 million of revenue -- clearly got some aggressive growth plans there. So focusing first on the single-family rental side, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the rollout there and maybe what you've been surprised on or maybe what's reaffirmed your views up to this point as you start leasing up communities and selling them? Are you seeing any interesting trends on who these renters are? Are they longer-term renters that are choosing to rent? Are they people waiting for a new home to be built? Any kind of either anecdotal or data you can provide there? And longer term, how big of a piece of the business do you want to target this at?"
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld I would say that the renters are not terribly di fferent than first-time home buyers. People moving into areas, they're looking for housing, they're looking for a better lifestyle. Things that probably have surprised us, level of demand and the lack of, not only from a rental standpoint, but from what I consider institutional type investor base that has bought the three that we saw. It may not be a white-hot for sale business this year compared to last year. But it is a white-hot build a ramp business, especially the way we're positioning these projects as kind of on the affordable land, self-contained, not intermixed with for sale housing."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alan Ratner Got it, so on that note, David, with strong as demand has been, I guess, first off, is the 35% margin that you guys generated at that business, is that a realistic intermediate-term margin on that $700+ million of revenue? And is the plan still to do the merchant-build approach? You mentioned the institutional capital, a lot of your peers have either partnered up with some of those investors and established joint ventures or some ongoing investment there.  It seems like you're kind of choosing more of the merchant-build approach. So profitability and longer-term, any reason why maybe the strategy changes there."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Bill Wheat We've got a small sample size thus far on those that we've plugged have been very pleased with the profit levels we've seen. I expect we will still see some projects that will generate those level of profits, but as we grow the platform and as we build the infrastructure in place to support a larger volume across the country. We wouldn't necessarily expect to continue to generate the same margin that we've shown on these first few, but do expect pretax profit margins to be higher on the rental business than on our for-sale business and to generate an accretive return, it needs to be a little bit higher, because of the assets are held a little bit longer. We do still expect to see very attractive profit levels on the rental business, but the current sample size is still little bit small."
4467435,"D.R. Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alan Ratner And as we've said before, as we learn the business then we'd make our capitalization decisions about how to go about capitalizing the business. So we're still evaluating that, looking at options there."

Horton, Inc.",DHI,11/9/2021,CEO David Auld on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"David Auld I will say that everything we worked on, everything we think about, we want to do things that are sustainable and scalable, and I can tell you that the rental side of this market certainly seem sustainable and with our platform is scalable.

4467443,"Cardinal Health, Inc.",CAH,11/9/2021,CEO Mike Kaufmann on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Lisa Gill  very much. , Mike and Jason and  for all the comments. Mike, I just want to go back to your comments around simplifying the operating model on the medical supply side, and, where you talked about driving the mix of Cardinal branded products. One, can you remind us what percentage of sales say are Cardinal branded products. And then 2, can you talk about the margin differential on those products? And then my third and last question would just be that, now that you have the divestiture of Cordis behind you -- the sale of Cordis behind you, are there other assets within Medical that would make sense to divest?"
4467443,"Cardinal Health, Inc.",CAH,11/9/2021,CEO Mike Kaufmann on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Mike Kaufmann , Lisa. . Tough questions to answer, because these aren't things we have historically given. Obviously I can say this. We believe there is plenty of room to grow. Some of our accounts were significantly penetrated in and others obviously were less penetrated in. So we do have good target by account that we're going after. So we think there's plenty of opportunity in there. It's one of the key reasons we believe in our longer-term guidance for Medical is the fact that we can do that. As far as margin rates go, generally, they are much more higher as a percentage and dollars and national brand. There are times and certain preferred brand programs, which is why we have them that we do prefer national brand. But in general, as a rule of thumb, our margin rates are much more significant on our Cardinal sourced or Cardinal manufactured products. And then lastly around Cordis, we're always looking at our entire portfolio of businesses to make sure we have the right type of businesses where we are positioned to win. There's nothing that sticks out to me in terms of a certain product category or that, but we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are exiting 36 countries. So not only do we look at products, we look at products by country and countries, and where we don't believe we have significant growth opportunity, whether it might be too much risk versus benefit, etc. We have made real conscious decisions to aggressively manage the number of countries and which is why we are exiting 36 countries to help simplify the model. All right. And up next, we will take a question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead."
4467443,"Cardinal Health, Inc.",CAH,11/9/2021,CEO Mike Kaufmann on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Charles Rhyee Yeah. . Mike and Jason, I want to just talk a little bit about the long-term growth targets a little bit here. I guess first is when we're starting the jump off point for these -- for the earnings and earnings growth, are you starting from fiscal '22. And is that a 5-year target that we should be thinking about or are we jumping off from fiscal '21 as the baseline year? And then secondly, within that, can you just remind us again, what the -- obviously the earnings this year are back half-way -- just remind us what the tailwinds that we should be considering as we build our model for the remainder of this fiscal year. And then lastly, those higher freight and shipping costs, do you assume those go away after this year as we think about it in relation to the long-term targets? ."
4467443,"Cardinal Health, Inc.",CAH,11/9/2021,CEO Mike Kaufmann on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Eric Percher . Appreciate the supply chain commentary. I'd like to get a little bit deeper here. We used to have guidance on commodity impact. So I think anything you can provide relative to $17 [billion] (ph) of revenue or the cost that you incur to give us some sense there. And then thinking about commodity and freight, what is clearly passed along versus what represents a decision that has to be made? And what I'm really looking for is $100 million to $125 million of increased expense. What does that represent relative to the total expense that you're seeing passed through?"
4467443,"Cardinal Health, Inc.",CAH,11/9/2021,CEO Mike Kaufmann on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kevin Caliendo  for taking my question. So if I'm doing the math right, it appears that the bad guy that is the incremental supply chain costs is larger than the good guy, the lower share count, and perhaps the lower tax rate. Am I doing -- am I thinking about that right. And the fact that you didn't change guidance, is that just you're still within the range but maybe it's the lower end of the range or you were just giving yourself a little room. How should we think about that?"
4467443,"Cardinal Health, Inc.",CAH,11/9/2021,CEO Mike Kaufmann on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Cherny . I want to dive a little bit more into some of the long-term guidance and concurrent contrast that with the dynamics you're seeing right now in terms of supply chain. I know that a lot of these are already control and clearly, some companies in the space are seeing similar  approaches. That being said, as you think about the ways you interact with your customers now, and interact with your partners and supplier partners, are there any ways that you can continue to evolve your business so that maybe we don't see ever spikes like this. But some of the fluctuations and volatility that you have seen at the supply chain in the past. And I'm thinking particularly on some of the raw material cost spikes that do come up from time-to-time. Are ways that can be mitigated in a more systematic fashion going forward so we don't have this level of volatility and [Indiscernible] surprise for stuff that, as I mentioned, a lot of it is -- tends to be out of your control."

4467443,"Cardinal Health, Inc.",CAH,11/9/2021,CEO Mike Kaufmann on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ricky Goldwasser , so on the long-term double-digit growth, I know you talked about the growth rate being sort of on a normalized basis. So should we take that long term double digit growth back out from 2020 to guidance sort of the abnormal costs that you are seeing, normalized for them and then apply that growth rate to get to 2023. That's the first part of the question and then secondly, as we think about these transitory costs in nature. You talked about a $100 to a$ 125 million costs related to the supply chain. What's the contribution of labor cost to that headwind? Because when we think about labor costs, we think about it as potentially more structural because once you raise someone salaries, it's difficult to bring it back down. So how should we think about that component within the additional cost?"
4467443,"Cardinal Health, Inc.",CAH,11/9/2021,CEO Mike Kaufmann on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Jason Hollar Sure. , Ricky. This is Jason. I'll start. As we talked about our long-term target, it's not expected or intended to be each and every year. There's a reason that we do a highlight that is an average over that period of time. So we're not providing fiscal '23 guidance with the statement. With that said, we think that there are over these longer periods of time that these would be the primary drivers and expectations we would have for our businesses. And how you described at about the normalized level as an example that 100 to 125 five were -- we indicated that we anticipate these costs remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22, we're not taking a position at this point as to how much, if any, carries over into fiscal '23, that is a terrific example of an important element of fiscal '23 guidance that we will provide in the future that is not at this point something that we feel comfortable being able to identify. And then your question about labor is a  one. We did not call it out because it is very consistent with what we had last quarter. So while labor, inflation, and those pressures are very real for us, like the whole industry, we are not seeing anything new and unique this quarter versus last quarter, and so we're not adding in any additional costs for that. But I would also highlight that even what was included in the original guidance was not nearly as substantial as the cost that we're referencing for and what was included before for commodities and international freight. Those are clearly the most significant items that drive that fluctuation, and items like labor as well as more domestic related costs such as domestic transportation and other fuel are all relatively low compared to those other 2 primary items, the international freight and commodities. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back over to CEO, Mike Kaufmann for closing remarks. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all of your questions. I'd like to conclude with just a few thoughts. I know the elevated product costs within the Medical Segment carried a lot of attention here today. But I want to just reiterate that, 1. We do believe the majority of these costs are temporary. 2. That we're taking aggressive enterprise-wide actions to help mitigate. And 3. We did reaffirm our non-GAAP EPS guidance. Additionally, in Pharma, we are encouraged by the profit growth we saw in the quarter, and the ongoing resiliency in this business. With an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization and our commitment to our dividend, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders while prioritizing investment in our growth businesses, simplifying our operating model, and strengthening our core businesses. And together this gives us confidence in achieving the new long-term growth targets that we provided. With that,  again. We hope you all have a good day. And this concludes today's call. We  again for your participation. You may now disconnect."
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Heidi Vesterinen , everyone. I have a question for Glenn, actually, and  for the info on why you joined IFF. What do you think of IFF's long-term targets rate? ."
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Glenn Richter Yeah, . . I would have to break them down relative to component parts. First of all, relative to topline, as we mentioned, we're very pleased for tracking extremely well versus the long-term targets and then when you take a look at how we're tracking versus competition, which is another  indicator. We're actually very pleased in terms of yards. So, we check that we'd say relative to our deleveraging target, getting below 3 times by year 3. We are feeling very comfortable with that. Combination of the cash flow generation from the business remains strong. And as you know, we've announced a couple of divestitures and we'll continue to look at other non-core businesses. So, I would check both that -- both the deleverage as well as our free cash flow. The area that really needs to work is around our long-term margin objective. As you know, we have a 26% EBITDA margin target that was easier when we started off with a higher number at the beginning of the year and versus the most recent guidance. We're now about 500 basis points off that relative to the guidance this year. So, as we approach our '22 plan, we're spending energy thinking about that multiyear target. I think structurally, there are couple of factors that we think still play in the favor of not only increasing where we are from an EBITDA margin, but potentially getting us back to that. 1, is clearly the biggest impact this year unexpected, has been the inflationary environment. And [Indiscernible] we thought would talk more about this, but we lost about 200 basis points this year at our margin, relative to inflation, net of what we expect to price, and in addition, we've had some pockets of higher use of freight costs in a couple of our business. So that's about 200 basis points. We still feel very confident on achieving the long-term synergy objectives, the cost synergies. And I would submit there are probably additional productivity in the business. I believe we strip out the material side of our business. We have over $4 billion of costs between our manufacturing operations and then our S&A, and I think we just sort of begun to scratch the surface relative to that with our  synergy targets. That being said, we are working very intently right now to sort of think about -- and actually -- our pricing initiatives and also think about a longer-term productivity as well."
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Matthew Deyoe . I appreciate all the added detail in the slides on the cost side, but just trying to understand better the margin contraction a bit, and how we got to the point where we're cutting the guidance again. If I look at 3Q and then moving into 4Q, could you talk a little bit about how costs are coming in versus where you had budgeted them. And on that end, can you push price to offset logistics costs for businesses that you've just won recently, or is this just a cost of doing business in that margin component is going to come down or improve when cost and capacity come out."
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Astrachan Yes. . And , everyone. I guess just building on the last question, Glenn, maybe specifically, if you're willing to talk about it, and obviously you're early in the process, but how do you currently see inflation for '22? And how should we think about when you expect to have enough pricing implemented to cover inflation? Obviously, you talked about $0.50 on the dollar, but what's the timeline for more pricing to be in place? And also, how do you think about offsets in terms of dollars versus margin recovery in the timing they're in?"
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Adam Samuelson Yes, . , everyone. I guess first, Andreas, you talked through some of the regional and business sales trends a little more on a year-to-date basis. Hoping you could frame that from the third quarter and into the fourth, where some of the pluses and minuses are. And specifically, with that organic sales guidance, where pricing was in the third quarter and where you think it's going to be in the fourth as we evaluate what the tailwind in 2022 could be, as you go back to customers on price. And if I could just sneak a quick other one in on synergy realization and just help us think about the cadence of cost and revenue synergy realization in '22, especially on the cost side, where would seem like an inflationary environment makes it harder to risk to achieve some of the procurement savings that had been previously targeted. ."
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Gunther Zechmann Hi,  for taking my question and welcome, Glenn. The photo on the flight looks very youthful so it must be an active ingredients from Lucas Meyer Cosmetics.  for sharing the percentage change in raw materials. Can I just check if the numbers you gave earlier, Glenn are what you include in the full-year guidance, or current run rate. And then pricing is up to 2% of sales in Q3. Can you share the exit run rate out of Q3 or and October if you have it? And what further increases you expect to push through, please."
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Roberts . And best wishes, Andreas, for the future, and welcome, Glenn. Andreas, your customers are seeing a lot of bulk raw material cost increases, so they're probably feeling even more cost pressure than you are. Do you see more reformulation going on? And is that providing any opportunities for more wins if your customers are reformulating their products a little bit more frequently here, because of their cost pressures?"
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeff Zekauskas  very much. In your initial remarks, G lenn, you said that there remains significant opportunities for portfolio optimization. Does that mean that there's another, I don't know, $500 million to $1 billion in revenues that can be monetized? And second, can you describe or articulate your capital expenditures for 2022 and '23. And what's the arc of capital expenditures? And what are the priorities to spend on?"
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Lauren Lieberman . . . I had two questions. First, was the generally operating expenses in the quarter, both SG&A and then R&D specifically, were down quite a bit. And I was curious if you could comment on how sustainable those changes were. If it reflects maybe incentive compensation again or more tactical reductions given the gross margin pressures. I was curious about that piece. And then the second thing unrelated, was on Pharma. You've given the capacity constraints that you've seen and demand outstripping supply, which is . The question is, what -- where is that demand going? What's the risk that rebuilding, if you call it relative market share, when you do get capacity up is a challenge? I mean, where is that business going, and how confident can we be that that will come back when you get the capacity up? ."
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Hi, . This is actually Mark Kreuer (ph) here, sitting in for Ghansham. Sorry to belabor the point a little bit here, but can you talk about where we are at from a price cost perspective across both the legacy IFF businesses and then the legacy Du Pont businesses, maybe on a dollar basis. That would be helpful. And then what's the historical price costs catch-up period for the 2 legacy businesses? Is there any meaningful difference in catch-up period across your various segments or regions?"
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Chris Parkinson .  very much. Just based on the growth outlook for certain pieces of the acquired N&B assets, are there any parallels which may require additional capacity in the coming years just giving healthy outlooks? The legacy owner used to speak about some recent expansions already essentially being sold out, so just trying to gauge where the portfolio stands. ."
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andreas Fibig No.  for the question. So, you will see probably the biggest expansion on our side on capacity in the health and bioscience area, in particular, on the enzyme business, where we believe that our technology is really top notch, and we see a huge demand from our customers as well. So, most of the investments goes into that area. We've seen some capacity increases, as we said on the Pharma business, but not to the same degree as on the IFF's Health & Biosciences business. The rest is basically a business that's usually on Scent and on Nourish, which is partly legacy N&B as well. But more, let's say, maintain than it is investment into new plans. Our final question today comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Your line is open."
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jonathan Feeney Hi.  very much for getting me in. Just a quick one. As the pricing process and your assessment of how easy that is to do, the dialogue, is there any significant difference in the acquired N&B businesses in the legacy businesses that you're running into? Because I did notice that it seems like the lag is a little bit er in the segments that are heavier on acquired revenue, but there may be other ex-plant nations for that. So just curious about the general nature of the business. Is it tougher to take pricing there?"
4467453,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,IFF,11/9/2021,CEO Andreas Fibig on Q3 2021 results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Andreas Fibig Absolutely. We have no further questions at this time. It is now my pleasure to hand the program back to A - Andreas Fibig for closing reQ - Marks.  very much for participation. I hope that it helped to explain where we are. We are very pleased where we are in the integration process, and certainly with the volume performance we're doing as a Company, which is good.  very much, and have a good day. This does conclude today's program.  for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Carden .  a lot for taking my questions. It sounds like you've made some good progress on reaching your hiring targets, which is  to hear. One of your competitors recently noted that it started implementing some more base pay raises. Without necessarily commenting on that competitor, is this some alignment that we've been seeing in the broader environment? Could we be seeing some more structural pressures here? ."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Aaron Alt One quick add, which is as Kevin called out, the vast majority of our Q1 and ultimately Q2 snapback costs are transitory, and we have the opportunity to cover the rest through further productivity efforts that we already have underway."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Mark Carden Awesome. That's . How do you guys think your fill rate currently compares to the broader industry? Presumably, you're still stronger than most, but any changes in the gap here? ."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican Mark,  for the follow-up. So we use external reporting and internal reporting through net promoter score to gauge our full rate and how it's trending. Ours has been improving over the last quarter, our merchant team has been working extremely hard for items that have what we call long-term out situations to find alternatives, find new suppliers, find alternative products that we can submit and suggest to our customers, provide those customers with suggestions on how to get those items cut into their menus, etc. Our team has worked harder than ever before on ensuring we can improve our rates. The answer to your question is yes, our performance is stronger than the industry, and yes, that gap widened in the quarter. We believe it's one of the components of our market share capture, but it's not the only reason. It's three reasons which are throughput capacity is higher because of the staffing health. Yes our fill rate is stronger. The third though, is our sales teams are just doing an extraordinarily good job of being out in the market, acquiring new customers and winning more share of wallet with existing customers."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alex Slagle Hey, . I may have missed something, but the local case growth on a 2-year basis versus '19 seem to decelerate more sequentially into the fiscal first quarter than the U.S. broadline trend even as you adjust for the tougher comparison. Wonder if we could discuss the dynamics you observed during the quarter where the local case momentum they had dragged a bit more? If I'm reading that right."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican Our local business is performing really well, Alex. we're pleased with the progress that we're making. We continue to win new customers at the local level, partnering and supporting our existing local customers with menu expansion in the like. If it's a percent of total that you're referencing, We've had a lot of success winning net new business at the national level within the education sector and within the healthcare sector, and perhaps the percent of total component that you are seeing is actually fueled not because of deceleration in our local business. We accelerated our per formance at the local level. It's the national sales and steamy business. We've just done extraordinarily well with winning new business and to be crystal clear, this isn't the guns or butter choice. One success at the national level does not hinder our ability over the long term to win at the local level. We're going to win at both national and local level, and again, our staffing, health and supply chain strength is what's enabling us to be able to do that."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alex Slagle That makes sense, and then if you could offer any color into the underlying trends in the various segments into October and just some thoughts on potential for that progress relative to '19 but moderate as we get into the holiday period. Just some tougher compares obviously, and in many ways can you get up against that?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Aaron Alt I would just add, you should take  note of our announcement of our results for October and understand that we are accelerating across our portfolio and we have significant opportunity both in our fiscal Q2 and as Kevin called up particularly, into Q3 and Q4."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Kelly Hi, , guys. Kevin I wanted to just revisit one thing that's been talked about a little bit here, but I know you've talked about your fill rates beating competitors, but it does sound like generally there's still some headwind here related to sort of inventory or even labor. Is it possible to quantify what you think is being left on the table associated with that, and then that gets into the second part of my question, which is, is it also possible to talk about where some of the segments are running versus 2019? And I ask all this because your case volume is still modestly below '19 in the U.S. which is obviously understandable. But I'm curious as to what all of this is saying about where your case volume can be. Let's call it by the end of this fiscal year or so or early next year, when life is obviously hopefully a lot more normal. So any color that you could add there would be super helpful, I think."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican Morning, Ed.  for the questions. Kevin. I'll start with fill rates. My language that are used in prepared remarks is we're performing better than the industry average, and that is the most accurate descriptor of our performance. We are below our historical fill rate standards. We set a very high bar for ourselves on ship on time and ship in full, and we are below our historical standards. The why is our inbound fill rate from our suppliers to us is well below our historical standards. Our output to our customers is actually significantly higher than the inbound fill rate to Sysco, and the how and why behind that, is the work we do to find substitutes to bridge customers to alternative products, and that's what's creating the relative strength of Sysco versus others, is the good work our merchant teams are doing to find product substitutions. I think your question is more like, is there even more sales to be had for fill rates improve? I would say, yes. How long it will take for fill rate to improve is subject for debate. So what we're doing, because we want to take ownership of what we can directly control is to be even better at managing fill rate. So we're improving our website to provide dynamic visibility to out-of-stocks and provide suggestions at point-of-sale to the customer on things that can be bought alternatively, and our sales teams and merchandising teams, when we find ourselves as I mentioned earlier, in a situation of long-term outs are being very proactive, providing quick selling bulletins to our sales teams, digital marketing pushes to our customers, including emails on suggesting to them alternatives in the likes. It's a core strength of our Company. I meaningfully desire for the inbound fill rate to Sysco to improve are working very closely with our suppliers on that, and we think it will improve, but not quickly. It's going to be a sequential steady slow improvement in fill rate into our fiscal 2023. As it relates to volume in the second part of your question, what I would say is we expect that the end of our fiscal Q3 to be back to 2019 from a volume perspective and we have the segments that will be at that level in Q2 of this fiscal year. Within our existing fiscal year, we will be b ack to 2019 volume levels. I'm not going to break it down by sector, it's not something I'm prepared to do this morning. But go ahead, please back to you."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Kelly Yeah. I got it, and when you say fiscal Q3, is that total Company volume or is that U.S. per outlines volume?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Kevin Hourican Total Company. All Sysco combined at the end of our Q3 will be at 2019 volume levels.
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Edward Kelly , and then just a quick follow-up for Aaron, I guess. Can you provide any additional color on fiscal second quarter? Historically, you have a little bit of a seasonal step back versus Q1. Just kind of curious as if we're going to see that again here. I look at consensus number; it's not far off of what you just reported for Q2. Any incremental thoughts there?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Aaron Alt I would offer 2 thoughts, which is we are enthusiastic about the continued positive trends we're seeing in the top line as we move into what historically pre-COVID may have been a seasonal period. But this year is like no other in that respect. But also then mitigated somewhat by the call out around the fact that we do continue to expect to invest heavily against snap back and the transformation in the second quarter. For us, we have confidence in the year. We have come to the long term, and we are quite excited about the progress the operational teams are making in service of fiscal '22 in Q1 and certainly in Q2."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Heinbockel Hey, guys, let me start with you've had a nice pick up, your performance versus the industry since the second half of last or rather, I think you're probably up in 20 or 25?debt state?. Where is that coming from predominantly? New versus existing accounts, pieces per stop, lines per stop. What are the 1 or 2 biggest drivers in that acceleration in share gains?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican , John. This is Kevin. The predominant reason for the market share capture is net new customers serve at Sysco both at the national and local level. So we're winning more new business than at any other point in time in Company history. The why breaks down to 2 pretty fundamentally basic things. First is the compensation model that we changed as you know, June of last year. We're now compensating our associates to be more prospecting versus cultivating, and that is paying dividends. So they drive the behaviors that we expect and we're seeing significant benefit in dividend from rewarding those associates for the good work they're doing in winning new business. The second reason is the supply chain health. We have customers almost on a daily basis, large and small coming to us, and asking for Sysco to take on their business. I won't name the State but we had a very large education customer come to us this week actually and say, we're not getting the support we need and can Sysco take on our business and we're finalizing the details of the contract which is why I'm not going to quote the where, but we expect that business to come on board by January 1. So that is a signal of our strength, the confidence that large and small customers have in our ability to ship on time in full, at rates er than the market. Jon, specifically what competitors segment that's coming from, I think it's all the above. But stronger players with broader access to inventory, clearly performing well. Back to prove that point, we have more inventory on-hand at this moment in time than we did pre-COVID. So are there select product shortages? Yes. But we've been able to invest in inventory. We have more inventory on hand than pre-COVID and our staffing levels are where we need them to be but every time we bring on more people our demand increases and then we have to go hire even more people, which is proving that there's continued runway, this was Aaron's point a moment ago, on our ability to grow our topline. As we continue to make progress on our staffing in through put capacity. John, back to you for any follow-up."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Heinbockel Maybe second question, right? If you think about lookout to '24, '25, take a longer-term view, are you more confident in gross margin being better than it's been historically or that the cost structure of the business will be less in light of a lot of the macro dynamics we're seeing today. Which one of those 2 is more likely to drive higher long-term profit margins?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nicole Miller . . First question is around the centralized pricing tool. So intuitively, I think about pricing power and price going up. But you have a lot of commentary about taking market share with the pricing tool, which makes me think about the value proposition of maybe not price down but neutral. So how do you balance that tension?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican Nicole, it's a  and you're right that my recent narrative of our pricing software has been about managing inflation. It's just because of the unprecedented environment that we're currently in, double-digit inflation is unique, and what the tools helping us in the current period is being very strategic and thoughtful about how to pass through that inflation in a responsible way, and being confident that when we make those decisions that they're executed well. We used to do that work manually through a large sales force, we can now do that through a strategic pricing office and when we make the decision it's executed immediately. Then we can monitor the impact of those decisions and update it on a daily basis if need be. So the reason for my narrative on inflation is just because of the environment we're in. For the longer term, the goal of the pricing project is to be a pricing system, excuse me, is to move to a strategic price optimization. I'm not going to name the category because I don't want to telegraph it, but we've got select categories where we are above-market from a pricing p erspective, we make decent, very high-quality margins and we're going to run price optimization tests. If we lower slightly our prices in that category. Does the sales growth more than offset the margin dilution? With a pricing software, you can do test versus control geography-based tests to optimize for the right price and how I've described that work is the following. We will make investments in certain items that are key value items, KVIs, and we will raise prices nominally in the tail of the inventory SKU, which is less visible to the customers, which therefore results in flattish margin rates by growing top line as my term is, right unpriced at the item customer level, which allows us to win more market shares. That's the longer-term goal of the projects. However, this system has been extremely useful during this early part of our fiscal 2022 and how we manage inflation."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Nicole Miller That's very helpful. . Second and final question, it's very helpful to understand the hiring and that some of that is coming back, but I am wondering about the underlying turnover thinking that could be a leading indicator. Could you speak to how turnover is trending, both like at the distribution facilities and for drivers as well."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Glass  very much. Just, first, back on gross margin. I understand your comments about gross margin, dollar s per case or gross margins per case or higher. Do you see demand restructuring that within certain categories that maybe factoring gross margin prices are too high. So your consumers or your customers are switching?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Glass , and Kevin, you open the door on loyalty and I know you want to talk about it in the future, but how do you think about loyalty in this business? Is it akin to what a consumer loyalty program is or is this more nuance? Is it more about adding value-added services versus discount? How would loyalty work in this industry do you think, at a high level?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican We've proven that a mom-and-pop independent restaurant operate similar to a consumer and retail, they decide based on value, they decide based on price, they decide based on services that you mentioned a moment ago. The value in the unlock of the loyalty program that we're building is making that customer specific what the offers are to them and making it indelibly clear to them the value that's being brought to them by Sysco. We're going to talk about more in the future because it's in pilot, as we speak, and we'd like to have actual factual results before we talk about things publicly. We're very pleased with the initial progress steps forward in our loyalty program. We are building the data and the plumbing from an IT perspective to execute against that effort nationwide and we are piloting it currently in select geographies and we will refine it, optimize it, iterated, but it will be similar to the types of loyalty programs that you're familiar with as a customer. The data is in the cloud, we're able to use machine learning to optimize against the data, and yes, there are value-added services that we will provide for those customers that are part of the program, that they will be able to take advantage of to improve their business results and outcome. So we're excited about it, we're bullish on it, and we'll talk more about it in future quarters."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Lauren Silberman . First on capital allocation, you announced plans to resume share repurchases and I think up to $500 million for the year. Can you just talk about your capital allocation priorities and how we should be thinking about the use of cash from here?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican I think Aaron described it very well. I think the punch line is we're ahead of schedule on that activity, which is why Aaron updated our guidance on when we would begin to stock buyback to this quarter."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Lauren Silberman . , and if I could just do a follow-up on that transitory nature of the elevated costs. Can you talk about what gives you the confidence that OpEx expenses and some of those investments can taper in the back half of the year, is it primarily reflecting expectations that staffing levels are closer to target and then within those incremental investments, snapback or transformation that what do you see as more transitory versus permanent? Can you expand on any of your initiative?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeffrey Bernstein .  very much. I have two questions. The first with the follow-on and it's been mentioned a few times, the sales momentum in the market s hare gains, which are ahead of the 1.2 times in the fiscal first quarter that you were targeting for the full year. It's harder, I guess to assess from the outside. So I'm just wondering, how do you arrive at success on that front? Maybe you can share what you believe the industry growth is. I know some of your peers large and even small often make similar claims to growing faster than the industry. Just trying to gauge how you're able to assess that maybe what the industry's growing relative to yours in the first quarter, if we should expect that type of commentary going forward on future quarterly calls?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican Yeah, Jeff. The 1.2 statement is specifically tied to Technomic's data. We get that data from them once per quarter and that is a data point that I can only report upon once per quarter as a result of that. We can see on a weekly, monthly-basis our relative growth. We can generally see the markets relative growth through other sources of data, but once per quarter we get the legitimate data feed from Technomic and that is where that data comes from."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jeffrey Bernstein Understood, and then the follow-up is just on the pricing in the margin percentage down, but the dollar is up, which I guess is what's important here, and I know you mentioned the ability to pass along inflation to customers, which I think it has historically been the big benefit in the drawer for investors to food service distribution and obviously with inflation right now, even more attractive. Just wondering your confidence and the ability to continue to pass through. I think there was some mention of maybe not much pushback, but wondering where the pushback is accelerating or you'd expected it to accelerate if the inflation is going to remain in the double-digits or whether you're really confident in the ability to pass it on for however long the inflation lasts. ."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican Jeffrey, the punch line is we are con fident that we can pass on the inflation. However, an editorial comment and then I'm going to provide some color comments. We don't think that double-digit inflation in perpetuity is good for the industry. It's not something we desire, it's not something we accept, and we're working very aggressively to push back on cost increases, find alternative suppliers, find alternative items that can lower the net landing cost for our customers, and we do believe that inflation will begin tapering. It's just going to take longer to begin tapering than what we originally expected back at the beginning of the year, which Aaron talked about accurately and clearly during his narrative. But with that said, we are not experiencing push back from our customers. The primary reason is end consumers aren't slowing down in their consumption of food away from home, in fact the opposite is true. We continue to see sequential improvement in our overall results tied to volume growth, and also obviously inflation at high levels, just to call out with their specificity. What we do with our customers, we have built a proprietary inflation tool calculator where we can take a inbound raw material to us that is significantly elevated from a cost perspective, and we can highlight for our customers what items on their menu are directly impacted by that inflationary item to then suggest to them that type of menu price changes that they should make, and that's what we mean with things like Value-Added Services, and I'm not talking about an obvious thing like meat and poultry, and talk about things like fats, shortenings, and oils are highly inflationary right now, and there are many different products on a menu that are impacted by particular raw ingredient costs increase. Our sales reps have been trained and equipped to be able to work with our end customers to educate them that this raw materials is increased. Here's our suggesting to you on what you can do with your menu price, and it's for that reason that our customers aren't pushing back to the degree that you might suspect externally because they view us as a partner and that's what we are. We're partnering with them to help them be successful and profitable and the good news for this industry is that the end consumer has remained robust and strong. Jeff, back to you for any further comments."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican Okay. , Jeff. Have a good day. Our last question comes from the line of Kelly Bania of BMO Capital."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kelly Bania Hi, .  for taking our questions. I just wanted to go back to the discussion of case volume, particularly versus 2019. Where exactly was that for the quarter, focusing on U.S. broadline, and within that, can you share any detail on the volume versus 19 for those core restaurant customers versus the non-restaurant hospitality business and industry segments?"
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican This is Kevin, just to bolster. We're not breaking it down by segment. We've been clear which segments remain behind. We have Travel and Hospitality, Business and Industry as two notable examples that from a volume perspective, remain down versus 19 levels. The good news is there's obviously significant offsets in strength within our restaurant sector, specifically, independent local sector, which is our most profitable sector. So ultimately that's the ultimate positive strength here is that the  restaurant in volume is the core strength at this point in time, and as Aaron said, the enterprise level will be at 19 levels by end of Q3."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kelly Bania Okay. That's helpful, and just wanted to also follow up on the comment that you've talked about for several quarters now with the 10% new local independent customers. Can you provide just an update on the penetration or share of wallet with these accounts and how that's progressing and the trajectory from here that you're expecting."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican Yeah, . John asked a question earlier, which are the primary drivers of the growth. Share of wallet has been steadily improving, but it has not been the primary source of the growth. The primary source of the growth has been net new customer wins, Kelly, over the last, let's call it, two years. I believe that we'll pivot in the future where the personalization work, pricing work we're doing, the work we're going to do on the loyalty program that I alluded to earlier. We will pivot to more of the growth coming from increased share of wallet, and mathematically, it's why we are confident that we will go from the 1.2 times market growth that we're currently delivering to the 1.5 times growth which will be the growth target we have for the third year of our 3-year strategy that we call the recipe for growth. So the percent contribution of the growth will pivot more towards share of wallet in the coming fiscal years."
4467508,Sysco Corporation,SYY,11/9/2021,CEO Kevin Hourican on Q1 2022 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Kevin Hourican , Kelly. This concludes today's conference call.  for participating. You may now disconnect."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Carlo Santarelli Hey everyone,  and Matt, congratulations. Greg, congratulations as well. Guys, obviously, you spent some time talking about Wynn Interactive and fully appreciating that you can't say much given where you are in the process. The decision to pivot, is that something where as you think about the way the market is shaping up and what I would assume you deem as unprofitable cohorts of customers that are being acquired right now by others. Is that something that in your view changes in the next 6 to 9 months or is it something where you'll wait until you actually see kind of that change start to happen?"
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings It's a , Carlo. As we've talked about before, we're really focused on lifetime value versus cost per acquisition, and when that ratio is favorable, we're more than happy to invest to drive long-term profitable growth. If you materially overshoot on CPA or offer non-economic promotions, then you can end up upside down on a customer pretty quickly, which obviously isn't very shareholder-friendly. In the current environment, there are certainly opportunities for us to do ROI positive acquisition. They absolutely exist. It's really a question of scale. If you're not trying to be aggressive and drive headline market share with large-scale brand spend, performance spend, hyper aggressive customer promos, there are absolutely opportunities to grow the business over the course of the longer-term."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Carlo Santarelli That's helpful. , Craig, and then Matt, maybe maybe this one's for you as you kind of talked about the consultation and some of the encouraging things that were coming out of those meetings. Do you have any sense coming out of there to the extent that you could share when you're starting to think about the next steps in the process and potentially some more visibility into that. Now the timeline of the process but maybe, some of the things that we should expect coming out of it."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Matt Maddox What I can tell you is when the government announced a consultative process, it was very structured at beginning timeline, and when the meetings we're going to be scheduled and everything happened exactly as they had laid out, and so we just been very happy with how open it's been and how constructive it's been, and I think that that is going to continue throughout '22 as Macau really focuses on the long-term health and stability which they have continued to say of the industry and of the region. So I can't give any specific dates or timeline, but what I can tell you is we're very confident in the process."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Joe Greff Matt, do you want to give any more description to the reason why you're stepping away now? I'm not sure the statement, the press release really kind of delved into that in  detail, and maybe there are reasons for that, and then my second question, Craig, I know you have opinions on casino real estate monetization. Given just the valuations we've seen in Las Vegas and elsewhere in regional casino markets, I was hoping you can give us your updated thoughts, with particular attention to EBH. ."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings On the real estate side, Joe, you know our position. Our position is, if any, over any reasonable period of time, our evaluation appropriately reflects the value of our real estate, then we're always more more content to control that real estate and be able to invest in that real estate, and that hasn't changed. To the extent that it does change, then obviously we will have to consider what's in the best interest of shareholders."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Thomas Allen , and I just want to reiterate congratulations to you both on, Matt, what's been a  career and Craig, congratulations on the new role."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Thomas Allen So the U.S. results were really stellar. Back in mid-2019, you guys had set targets of $515 million for Vegas, and $275 million for Boston. Any updated thoughts around the longer-term outlook for those properties?"
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings There isn't one piece of the business, Thomas, that we haven't touched and addressed and changed and adapted. So really these 2 assets are firing on all cylinders."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Thomas Allen All right. , and then just following up on the transition, any thoughts on the new CFO, and then Craig, are you going to still run Wynn Interactive? How are you thinking about that? ."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings Sure. We're fortunate at the Company that we have a reasonably deep bench at the corporate level, and we've hired some real talent on the Wynn Interactive side, so we'll be coming back to you soon with a revised management structure and an outlook, and we'll talk to you about it then. Stay tuned."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shaun Kelley . , everyone, and yeah, Matt, Craig, for my congratulations as well. Matt, it's been a long number of years, so look forward to hearing what's next on. Craig, I'd love to hit on a couple of comments, and I know there's only so much you can probably cover right now on Interactive. The comments just has been on CPA as I know you know this formula better than probably anyone else on this call. Can you talk about the prevailing level of what you're seeing out there because one challenge we, I think, all running to as analyst is the formula spits out a little bit of whatever you want. So the more you spend on marketing, you can justify it if your LTV is higher and it's hard for us to kind of independently validate. So just a little bit of thought around what is that prevailing level of spend out there and what do you want it to be to make the model or math work to what you think is going to be a profitable long-term?"
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings Sure. Shaun. We don't quote specific CPAs or specific LTVs. LTVs, of course, are a pretty lengthy forward-looking estimate. What I would say is that you really have 3 elements that impact this. You have brand spend. You have performance spend where you're actually buying digital ads to bring customers directly to the product, and then you have the underlying promotion that you're providing to the customer, and some participants in the market have structural advantages in those areas, some participants don't, and so when you're, when you're pulling all 3 of those levers into a  very, very aggressive market where there's a ton of competition in it and ton of folks doing the same thing, it could become particularly difficult, particularly in states where you're entering the market late. In Arizona as an example, where we did 26,000 plus FTDs over the course of September, that's a  outcome. Other states where maybe you're entering or scaling a little bit later becomes much more offer-driven and you can again, pretty quickly get upside down. I think what we're focused on is leveraging the advantages that we have. We have a database, we have a brand, and to the extent that we're not aggressively chasing every single lever. We can build a business over the longer term that's a  business into what will eventually be a really, really strong TAM."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Shaun Kelley  for that, and then maybe a pivot for my follow-up, but just focused on or looking out to Las Vegas for 2022. You obviously have a shiny, brand-new convention center that's never been fully able to be utilized. Can you talk a little bit about how you expect that to ramp in '22, and when we might be at a level that you might consider run rate are really showing the potential of all believers that you have there?"
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Grambling . I'll offer my congrats and best wishes as well. Two follow-ups to earlier questions. First, on Macau, while the timing of recovery's uncertain, given your confidence in the concession renewal, what are some of the things that you're doing now or plan on doing to change the positioning of the assets to cater more to premium mass?"
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ian Coughlan Over the last 3 years, we've been pivoting as luxury assets that were formerly taken up by junket operators, and we've been opening them up for premium mass, whether it's at villas in our towers, high-end suites, and general gaming spaces, and we are fortunate to have the best assets and best service in market. So the pivot is very, very straightforward for us."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Grambling , and then maybe as an unrelated follow-up on real estate value. Craig, I appreciate the response on valuation so if we were to look Vegas and Boston assets separately, are the two markets seeing different potential differences in capital intensity and valuation from where you sit today? ."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings Well, on the capital intensity side, naturally Boston is going to be less capital intensive. It's just the nature of the business there and the nature of the asset relative to Vegas. Vegas is a market of pretty consistent reinvention, and as Matt mentioned, we've done an incredible job at that. On the valuation side, again, I think you have to look over any reasonable period of time and look at the value of the real estate within the broader business. So we watch that very closely. We watch it all the time, and we're very conscientious of the underlying real estate value, but that has historically been our position and it remains unchanged."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Stephen Grambling Do you think that the competitors actually pursuing this have actually changed the competitive environment, perhaps to your beneficiary? ."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings Have they changed the competitive environment? It's just a form of financing. It's no different than a piece of debt. It just happens to be over time a more expensive piece of debt than we observe in the bond markets today. At the end of the day, each operator is going to make their own decision and form their own strategy. Being an OpCo has its advantages and has its disadvantages depending upon what's happening in the broader business. So I don't think it's an operational question other than the willingness to continue to reinvest in your business and how you do that. But I don't think it's a day-to-day operational question per say."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Cassandra Lee Hi. This is Cassandra asking on behalf of David. First, congratulations to both Matt and Craig on behalf of David, and  for taking my questions. I would like to ask about New York. You got the license yesterday. Just given the high tax rate at 51% and your comment around pivoting in your approach to scalability. So how are you thinking about your launch in New York?"
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings . Yes, we were really pleased to be awarded that license yesterday, and New York clearly has the potential to be one of the largest addressable markets in the U.S. Given the tax rate as you point out, it's a prime example of a market where you need to be incredibly prudent with respect to marketing and bonus expense, which obviously is, as you also pointed out, a theme that I discussed pretty heavily in my prepared remarks. We have a  database in New York, particularly in the more affluent areas of the state, and certainly to the extent that you are prudent with marketing spend and bonusing, there's the opportunity to build a business there over time, but no doubt the tax rate is the headwind that we all have to acknowledge."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Cassandra Lee Got it, and if I may follow up, I think there is requests for information in New York for a downstate license. Any thoughts around potentially pursuing that or pursuing other organic or greenfield opportunities for Wynn?"
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Matt Maddox Yeah. This is Matt, and Craig and I have for the last five-plus years, we work on these things together, and that is what Wynn does. So I think we will be participating in the New York process up until it seems either like a good deal or uneconomic and it's hard to know. But that's one that we're going to keep a close eye on, and there are other potential new jurisdictions that could be really exciting, actually, and what's so  about this Company is our design team and architecture team over a 100 people that are responsible for mirage, and Treasure Island, and Bellagio, and Wynn, basically the modern-day integrated resort, are all intact and excited, and you can't build something new if you haven't built these things in the past, and our team is really good at that and understands how to make these things work both financially, but more importantly for the customers. So if a new opportunit y comes up, that makes sense for Wynn and the Wynn brand, I think that the team will continue to look at it."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings . Operator, we have time for one last question. . Our last question is from Robin Farley with UBS. You may go ahead."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robin Farley . . Craig, let me add my congratulations on top of everyone else's on the new role. I had a question about the potential gaming launched changes in Macau and just wondering your view is on, if government approvals required for dividends, would that be a concern in terms of ability to get shareholders return on the investment there, where would you be comfortable that would not be a factor that would come into play."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Ian Coughlan This is Ian. We've been very impressed with the partnership orientation of government with their pragmatism and also the progress that's been made. It's being very transparent. They've allowed us to engage directly in person and also in writing. We've shared our concern. We don't have clarity on a number of the issues at this point, but we look at clarity further along the way. All of the concessions have similar concerns and we believe that the fact that we've aired them and share d them, that they will be given very serious consideration, like government. Ultimately, we're in partnership with government. They're also very aware of the growing regional competition, particularly with Japan now kicking up, so there is a desire for stability going forward, and they understand that we're businesses that need to reinvest and continue to develop so we feel a lot of support from government. It's a process, we'll get more information further down the line, but we're very confident that they have are best interest in hearts."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Robin Farley That's . That's a really helpful color. . Can I follow up on a quick one related to the online gaming strategy if I could? I'm just curious this approach of so many online betting operators is that revenue matters early and I would say not at any cost, and the market seems very willing to value on multiples of revenue, and I mean, I'm old-school and I think as you do that, that profitability matters more than that. But what are your thoughts about if you don't focus on that in the early stages? You mentioned that entering late is more offer-driven may be than getting in on Day 1, and so it seems like that suggests that you do see a trade-off that there will be expense later if you don't capture the top-line market share up front. So wonder if you could just put some context around that? ."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings Sure. Sure, Robin. First let me say that we fully intend to be Day 1 in every market that we address. We will be there Day 1. The important thing to keep in mind is not so much \""Income Statement Profitability\"". It's profitability of cost per acquisition versus lifetime value. It's making sure that every first deposit or that you drive, or every cohort of first depositors that you drive are ultimately profitable on a lifetime value basis. So that's where we're focused. It's much more about the return on the spend, the return on the ad spend, and certainly we believe that we have the ability to do that over time. It doesn't mean that we're going to intentionally enter markets late."
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Robin Farley I wasn't suggesting that you would but just maybe that holding back  on the spend would mean that the revenue market share wouldn't be as high as the profitability market share. But that's helpful context.  very much.
4467644,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",WYNN,11/10/2021,CEO Matt Maddox on Q3 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Craig Billings All right, everybody.  for joining today. We'll talk to you next quarter. . That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."
4468171,The Walt Disney Company,DIS,11/11/2021,CEO Bob Chapek on Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Ben Swinburne . . Bob and/or Christine. I think there's 2 areas where expectations have probably been out of line with reality this year, that's a weight on the stock. One of them is the Disney+ net adds, the other is probably more recently on Parks margins and you talked a lot about both of those in your prepared remarks. But maybe you could just spend a minute, on both topics. On Disney+, it sounds like we should think about net-adds being higher in 23 and 24 than in 22 based on the surge that I think you mentioned, Bob, on the programming side. So I'm wondering if you could help us with that. I think that would help set the expectations in the right spot, and then on the Parks front. Bob, you talked a lot about Parks margins, when you get back to prior peak revenues being at or maybe even higher than before, but obviously there is also not a linear ramp on the margin front either. So if you could talk a little bit about how expenses come back into the business over the course of time as it recovers relative to revenue, so we make sure we're thinking about that business the right way in this set of unusual circumstance coming out of a pandemic. ."
4468171,The Walt Disney Company,DIS,11/11/2021,CEO Bob Chapek on Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Christine McCarthy , Bob, and , Ben. I'm glad you asked the question on Parks expenses, and I know you know this business well, but just for the benefit of some others that maybe newer to following Disney. Let's remember that the Parks expenses are in 3 buckets, fixed, which is quite substantial, semi-fixed, and variable. So variable was where we were really able to make some adjustments during COVID. But the other fixed and semi-fixed buckets are ones that we have to carry on regardless of the operating environment that we found ourselves in. So as we come back online, we've also done a lot of work on fundamentally changing some of the ways we've have done business on both the revenue side and the cost side to optimize margins. What you see this fourth quarter is an overall margin for the global business, for DPEP, a little under 12%, and that's well below our pre-COVID levels. I've said this before and I'll say it again, that I believe that we will get not only back too, but have high probability of exceeding those previous margin levels in our parks because of some of the things we've done. We're using date-based pricing. We're strategically managing attendance. We do have some promotional offers that are really meant to balance yield with the demand, given capacity on any given day or week during the year, and on the cost efficiency side, we really made some improvements, not only to the cost side, but also that improves the guest experience. So those are things like the mobile food ordering that we have, a lot of people who have been to our parks since we reopened really enjoyed that. There's contactless check-ins at our hotels; lots of people enjoy that as well. We have virtual queues for selected attractions, and we're once again really looking at even physical park improvements that allow for better guests movement throughout the Parks. So while these margins will remain impacted, while we are still operating under capacity constraints, again, we believe over the long term that these fundamental changes are going to result in higher margins overall. So  for asking that question, and the other thing I would say is, Bob mentioned, Genie. Genie we have launched in Walt Disney World. We have not yet launched it in Disneyland, and I think when we have that exposure to the Disneyland, people who come to visit Disneyland, the response will be as strong if not stronger. ."
4468171,The Walt Disney Company,DIS,11/11/2021,CEO Bob Chapek on Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Alexia Quadrani . Just a few questions if I may. First, ARPU on Hotstar is obviously lower than core Disney+ jobs. I'm curious if you could elaborate on the opportunity to narrow that gap over time and does it eventually become profitable contributor and maybe how much investment is needed in a big picture in that property? Then just my follow-up question is on your decision to revert back to include the Asheboro releases, at least for now, it looks like even though they might be lost incurring initially, why do you ultimately feel that's a better model? Was it piracy, any color there? ."
4468171,The Walt Disney Company,DIS,11/11/2021,CEO Bob Chapek on Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Michael Nathanson . Hey, Tammy. I have two. One is I appreciate your view that the content side would get better, and it will drive some growth. But I really want to focus on the U.S. What gives you confidence that that's what is the reason for the slowing growth. Are there any cohorts, any demographics that you're underpenetrated, and perhaps the widening out of content is an issue versus just more new content. That's one, and then two is we have covered Disney a long time, but I've never seen this much inflation befo re, and I don't think any of us have in 30 years. I wonder how will you mitigate that inflation, and at what point it would start becoming a meaningful drag on the margin recovery that you identified. ."
4468171,The Walt Disney Company,DIS,11/11/2021,CEO Bob Chapek on Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Christine McCarthy , Bob. Hi, Michael. I think you asked a question that's on the minds of every CFO and every senior management team of companies out there. Inflationary pressures are something we are all looking at and trying to assess, and think about how do we manage through it. This is also one that I just mentioned, we've already experienced in some parts of our business. So over the past year or so, we've talked about the increase in the price of content. You see the content, that because of just the competition for talent for everything that's involved in productions, content costs have gone up. Where we see it directly in our parks business is primarily through the hourly wage inflation that we've seen through contract renegotiation in our commitment to paying our park workers well, and then we have things on the cost of goods side and it's interesting, just last week I was talking to our Parks Senior Team about things we could do there, and there are lots of things that are worth talking about. We can adjust suppliers, we can substitute products, we can cut portion size which is probably good for some people's waistlines. We can look at pricing where necessary, but we aren't going to go just straight up across an increased prices. We're really going to try to get the algorithm right to cut where we can and not necessarily do things the same way. As I mentioned, we're also using technology to reduce some of our operating costs, and that gives us a little bit of headroom also to absorb some inflation. But we're really trying to use our heads here to come up with a way to kind of mitigate some of these challenges that we have. It's a , and I'm sure it's one that you could ask every single Company in your coverage universe. ."
4468171,The Walt Disney Company,DIS,11/11/2021,CEO Bob Chapek on Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tammy Munsey  Michael. Operator, we have time for one more question. Certainly. Our final question for today then comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please."
4468171,The Walt Disney Company,DIS,11/11/2021,CEO Bob Chapek on Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Jessica Reif Ehrlich . Two, of course. First, could you talk about the advertising outlook? There's a lot of moving pieces here between strong upfront, good sports ratings, but supply chain issues affecting some categories, and within advertising, if you could talk a little bit more about Hulu advertising, what's going on there with your aired light service versus pure premium subscription, and then the second question is, I know Bob mentioned in prepared remarks, sports betting. Can you frame or give us any color on the opportunity? Obviously, it's an area of growth as more states are approving it and it effects advertising, which should be good for the stations. But how can you participate in a bigger way while still protecting the ESPN brand?"
4468171,The Walt Disney Company,DIS,11/11/2021,CEO Bob Chapek on Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Christine McCarthy Okay. I'll take the advertising question, Jessica. So overall, the ad market is strong across our entire DMED portfolio, and the sports market is strong, and it's really being driven by football at both the college and professional level, NHL and the NBA. We are seeing some impact from supply chain issues impacting certain sales categories than the 2 that I would just call out are autos in technology and those are for obvious reasons that we all know about, the chip shortage. On Hulu specifically, we're really pleased with the advertising demand we've seen for Hulu, and we believe the overall addressable market in the U.S. market will continue to grow. Hulu, we believe also has some real strategic advantages in this space. We've got a  slate of premium content and we've developed the ability to use our data to offer that targeting advertising, that advertisers really desire, and we also have a purpose built and unified ad platform. I mentioned this last quarter, but that's really helped us grow in addressable advertising. So we'll continue to make investments in technologies that are going to allow us to continue to exploit this advertising that we see on Hulu, and it's automating the sales process with programmatic, and advertisers self-service channels that we think are really going to continue to show good growth. So we expect advertising to continue to be an important driver of Hulu revenues going forward. ."
4468171,The Walt Disney Company,DIS,11/11/2021,CEO Bob Chapek on Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Tammy Munsey Jessica, .

4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,George Tong You're guiding to Scores revenue growth up 6% next year. That excludes any special pricing increases. Could you talk about what the assumptions are and factors are that go into your 6% growth outlook?
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"William Lansing It's a continuation. We break it down into the pieces. And we look at mortgage. We look at auto. We look at card. We look at prescreen. So we look at all the pieces and put estimates on that. We use industry forecasts to inform those estimates, although we're not always exactly on top, we form our own views. And that's basically how we do it. That's how we got to the 6%. I mean it's a combination of -- it combines both volume increases based on industry and price increases as well."
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,George Tong Okay. Got it. So there is some measure of underlying pricing increase in there?
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Michael McLaughlin And George, I would add to that. I just -- sorry to interrupt, just looking across those segments, we do our best to predict volumes for the 3 major parts of our B2B business. Just like you probably do. We don't have a crystal ball. But I can say that our expectations for mortgage are in line with what you would find from third-party forecasters. And likewise, we expect modest but positive growth in the auto and credit card and other segments."
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"George Tong Okay. Yes. That's helpful. That was the extra color I was hoping to get. And then with the extra Software disclosures, I guess if we dive into ARR performance, the percentage of ARR that's on platforms at 14%, it's nearly double what it was about 2 years ago. What are your expectations for how that continues to tick higher? What's embedded in your 2022 guide? And how would you expect that trajectory to just perform in the years ahead?"
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Michael McLaughlin And overall, if you just do the math on our guidance, the 6% total revenue growth is approximately equal in terms of percentage between the Software and Scores business. So if you expect very strong continued growth in the platform business , we think our platform is going to be relatively flat."
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,George Tong Okay. So 50% is a good run rate growth to apply to the platform piece.
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Surinder Thind As a follow-up to the ARR question and more specifically the net revenue retention rate of 143% for the platform, can you talk about the sales process and how that works for the client in terms of what the client initially buys and kind of what the upsell is and how the timing of the upsell works?"
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"William Lansing Sure. And obviously, it varies from client to client. Typically, we put the platform in with a specific number of use cases and very specific ideas about how the platform will be used and what problem is being solved. But increasingly, it's being put in with a view to being able to provide additional solutions later on. And what we're seeing -- a classic land-and-expand strategy. And what we're seeing is that's working with our current platform customers and what -- and the ones that have gone in less recently, we're seeing expansion. We're seeing new uses, new ways of using the platform, and so -- which is what's really informing that 143% retention rate."
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Surinder Thind That's helpful. And then in terms of just bringing on new clients onto the platform, can you talk a little bit about the conversations you're having there and what it's kind of taking to get them across the finish line and the time lines generally involved?"
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"William Lansing The time line is a little bit longer than our historic 270-day sales cycle with our older applications. But the -- what's happening is it's a bigger deal at the client. It's being brought in as part of a broader strategy. It's being brought in with a view to using it to really interact with consumer customers strategically. And so it is a bigger, more complicated conversation, but it's -- we're kind of in the middle of it. We're right in the middle of the way our clients want to interact with our consumer customers. We're seeing ourselves pop up in their strategy presentations."
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Surinder Thind Got it. And just kind of a technical question on the accounting part of the ARR maybe. Is there a kind of a volume component to  it in the sense that there's a head count of the number of people that are on there, all else equal, or usage?"
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,Michael McLaughlin I'm not following the head count part of it. Are you talking about our contracts that are usage-based as opposed to based on minimums per year?
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Surinder Thind Yes, the combination of minimums versus usage base. So let's say a use case has -- a lender has, I don't know, 10 million accounts or something like that as a use case or was part of that. And then obviously, that number can change. So are there kind of bands? Or how does that work? Just to understand what the volatility might be."
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Michael McLaughlin Yes, it's a . So our contracts have both. Many have minimums. Many have usage components. Some have minimum with usage if you exceed a certain amount of volume or use cases or accounts. What we do is if it's minimums, that's what goes in the ARR unless and until that customer exceeds the minimums, and then that additional run rate is added to ARR in the period in which that occurs. If it's a purely usage-based contract, some of our customer communication services contracts, for example, are based on the number of messages that are sent in cases where fraud is identified or what have you. There, we estimate once the solution has been installed and is running and has shown a stabilized usage rate, we then use that as the ARR that we will enter into the quarter's results. If that usage goes up or down in future quarters, we adjust ARR accordingly. Does that make sense?"
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"Kyle Peterson Just wanted to touch on the margins. Obviously, it came in really strong this quarter. I know there's been a lot of moving pieces with deemphasizing professional services and the C&R divestiture. But just wanted to get any thoughts on what your assumptions would be on like the sustainability of operating margins in line with what we saw this quarter."
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"Michael McLaughlin There isn't anything structural that has changed or we expect to change in the quarters ahead in fiscal '22 versus what you've seen in recent quarters other than the fact that we expect to return to traveling. So if you look at the expense breakdown in our supplemental materials, I think we spent $0.5 million on T&E in Q4. That's going to go back up to a more normal rate, or at least that's what we're projecting. Professional services, as that declines, that's a low gross margin business, therefore, a high cost of goods sold business. So the cost of goods sold declines as those revenues go down. But otherwise, in terms of what we're investing in R&D and go-to-market and G&A, nothing dramatic has changed in our forecast versus our historical other than we've taken out a lot of expense from divestitures."
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,Kyle Peterson Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on the B2C side. The performance continues to be really impressive for Scores. Is this something that you guys think you can keep growing kind of above trend? It seems like you guys are putting up significantly faster growth than what we're seeing with some of the other players in the space.
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Mazzoni This is John Mazzoni filling in for Ashish. Maybe just a quick one on the B2B revenues. I know there was a onetime impact that if adjusted, that would be around 15%. How should we think about these moving forward, especially going into kind of the '22?"
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"William Lansing Those kinds of onetimers happen periodically. It is kind of part of the business. We do audits and true-ups every few years with different channel partners. And so can you expect them to continue? Yes, there will be things like that, that are a little bit unpredictable. But it is part of the business."
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Q,"John Mazzoni Understood. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. How do you see the Software business evolving over time? Maybe of a longer-term perspective, just as we kind of wrap our heads around these new metrics, what could be a longer-term growth rate or any type of things that investors should be paying attention to?"
4468200,Fair Isaac Corp,FICO,11/11/2021,CEO William Lansing on Q4 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,A,"William Lansing Okay. With the caveat that this is not guidance, I would say look at our platform growth, 50% platform growth, which tells you that we have something there that the market wants. We have a large number -- a large number -- 19 enterprise customers, large customers who have adopted the platform and many more in the pipeline. And what we're seeing is that's a combination of conversion, substitution of platform solutions for more historical solutions, but it's also growth. It's also new stuff. And so over time -- and it could be a very long time. But over time, you'll see our software transition from our older solutions to p latform solutions and the platform solutions piece is growing a lot faster. So will our growth rate go up? Yes, it almost certainly will go up as we do more and more of our total Software business on the platform. So if today is 6%, I would just extrapolate out from 6% upward. And I don't know how many years it will take, but we will be in double digits eventually. And Mr. Weber, there are no further questions. All right.  all for joining today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. This concludes the call. And that will conclude the conference call for today. We  very much for your participation. You may now disconnect."
